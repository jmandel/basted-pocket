Chickpeas add creamy texture, contrasting the crisp bite of vibrant veggies. Use your favorite combination: Yellow bell peppers, cucumbers, snap peas, radishes, celery, asparagus and cabbage are all great options. You can make the salad an hour ahead and let the savory tahini-garlic sauce soak into the noodles (at room temperature); just give it a quick toss before serving so that everything is evenly coated in the luscious sauce. If chilled, pull the salad from the refrigerator 10 minutes before serving to allow the sauce to soften, then give it a nice mix. ",

      "description": "A breeze to make on busy weeknights, this fresh, colorful ramen salad is equally tasty at room temperature or chilled — which means it’s particularly picnic-friendly. Chickpeas add creamy texture, contrasting the crisp bite of vibrant veggies. Use your favorite combination: Yellow bell peppers, cucumbers, snap peas, radishes, celery, asparagus and cabbage are all great options. You can make the salad an hour ahead and let the savory tahini-garlic sauce soak into the noodles (at room temperature); just give it a quick toss before serving so that everything is evenly coated in the luscious sauce. If chilled, pull the salad from the refrigerator 10 minutes before serving to allow the sauce to soften, then give it a nice mix. ",
