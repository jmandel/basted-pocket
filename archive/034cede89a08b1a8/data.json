It’s based on the classic French preparation called bonne femme, which refers to simple, homey dishes often containing wine, mushrooms and cream. Here, bacon and tomatoes are added to the sauce, giving it brawny depth and brightness. You can use any kind of mild, white-fleshed fish you like. Just watch it carefully so the fillets don’t overcook under the broiler.",

The broiler is very fast and easy and gives the fish and the mushrooms a bit of a roasted look and taste.  I checked the fish internal temp every 3 minutes or so  with a Thermoworks probe and pulled it at around 130 degrees F. I suggest making it as written.",

I often sub buttermilk for cream in dishes, it lightens it and adds a little zing. This was delicious.",

      "description": "This delightful fish recipe is inspired by a recipe from the chef Hugue Dufour of M. Wells restaurant in Long Island City, Queens. It’s based on the classic French preparation called bonne femme, which refers to simple, homey dishes often containing wine, mushrooms and cream. Here, bacon and tomatoes are added to the sauce, giving it brawny depth and brightness. You can use any kind of mild, white-fleshed fish you like. Just watch it carefully so the fillets don’t overcook under the broiler.",
