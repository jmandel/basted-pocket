          "text": "Maangchi, when you put the anchovy stock in the freezer, do you separate into 1-cup portions? What is easiest in your opinion? I imagine it would be difficult to use to make another soup if it is one big, frozen block. Or do you thaw the entire portion, take what you need, and re-freeze leftovers? Does it cause it to degrade (thaw, freeze)...? I would like to make this stock to keep in the freezer and save time when cooking during the weekdays. You can use it for so many delicious dishes! :-) Thanks again!",

          "text": "Hi Maangchi! Very interesting recipe for me. I was born and lived many years in Uzbekistan, where, as You know, as i remember, there were many Koreans (&quot;Koryo Saram&quot;), that was deported into Middle Asia in the time of WWII. Guksu (or &quot;Kuksu&quot; in the russificated adoptation of the word) is very populuar dish both among the Uzbekistan&#039;s koreans and other peoples living in that land. Nevertheless, this dish differs from the recipe You kindly offer us. In our version - obviously, adopted under local conditions - guksu is a &quot;cold summer soup&quot;, like spanish &quot;gaspaccho&quot;, russian &quot;okroshka&quot; or uzbekish &quot;chalop&quot;. It consists from three parts: 1. Soup base (named &quot;kuksi-muri&quot;) - chilled water with addition of soybean souce, sodium glutamate, vinegar and sugar. 2. Thin noodles. 3. A lot of salads and other add-ons: fried beef with cabbage, fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, green onion, thin egg pancakes etc.",

That are all very well-known since my childhood scents :-) There is a whole district in Uzbekistan capital, Tashkent, where live many ethnical Koreans, named &quot;Kuylyuk&quot;, where You can find a lot of such little restaurants. I was very lucky to find one of such restaurant here, at north of the Russia, in St. Petersburg. Of course, i make some dishes myself for my family from time to time, too. Thank You for Your blog! Perhaps, it could be interesting for You: in Tashkent lives well-known in russian blogosphere dame, Lilia Nikolenko, which is much more experienced in the cuisine of Uzbekistan Koreans than me. That is her site: www.azu.uz. She writes in Russian, but speaks English freely, so You can communicate with her in English.",
