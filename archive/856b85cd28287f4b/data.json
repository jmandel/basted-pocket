      "description": "This soup is as cozy as mushroom-barley soup and as vibrant as spring. Chewy barley, crisp asparagus and peas lay in a broth bolstered by umami-rich soy sauce and miso. Hits of fresh ginger and vinegar enliven the mix. Feel free to swap in other vegetables that catch your eye: Add leeks and hearty greens with the barley, and quicker-cooking vegetables like sliced turnips or snap peas with the asparagus. Thinly slicing the asparagus makes it easier to eat with a spoon, but cut them larger if you prefer it. For more protein, add cubed soft or firm tofu to bowls, or stir a beaten egg into the pot as you would for hot and sour soup.",

I went overboard on the asparagus and peas, but we loved it - nearly cleared the pot out - and I’ll definitely be making it again.

I made the recipe exactly as written and didn't taste the miso, the ginger, nor the rice vinegar. It tasted like some barley with asparagus and peas thrown in to a pot of water, and that's it. I finished two small bowls in about five minutes, and it certainly didn't constitute a meal. I would never, ever, bother to make this again.",

The miso paste I use is very salty, so I reduced it to 2 TBSP, and I added an extra cup of good store bought vegetable broth with the water, and I cut the barley in half. This, to me, was perfect.

I went with the pearled as suggested.  I paused the recipe after step one for a few hours prior to adding the vegetables and the the barley continued to expand soaking up a great deal of the liquid.  This became quite thick and still very yummy.  Reminded us of risotto.  Looking forward to trying some variations",

      "description": "This soup is as cozy as mushroom-barley soup and as vibrant as spring. Chewy barley, crisp asparagus and peas lay in a broth bolstered by umami-rich soy sauce and miso. Hits of fresh ginger and vinegar enliven the mix. Feel free to swap in other vegetables that catch your eye: Add leeks and hearty greens with the barley, and quicker-cooking vegetables like sliced turnips or snap peas with the asparagus. Thinly slicing the asparagus makes it easier to eat with a spoon, but cut them larger if you prefer it. For more protein, add cubed soft or firm tofu to bowls, or stir a beaten egg into the pot as you would for hot and sour soup.",
