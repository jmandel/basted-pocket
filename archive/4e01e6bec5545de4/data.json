So, I pureed 5oz scallions and 1/8c olive oil with enough water to make a slurry and lotsa salt. Poured it into a Pyrex dish, loosely covered w/foil and cooked it in the Instant Pot on Manual for 30 min, NR.\nI'm not sure if it's 'correct' but it's army green, sweet, mellow and so good. Put over pasta with melty cheese and peas. Curl-up-on-the-couch, face-in-the-bowl, leave-me-be meal.",

Adding more scallions at the end brings a fresh complexity to the sauce, but if you want to keep the whole thing mellow and sweet, feel free to omit that step, and just cook all the scallions at once. It's great as a dressing for noodles, boiled or roasted vegetables and simple meats and fish.",
