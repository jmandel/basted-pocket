          "text": "Do you have a recipe for pepper bugak? It was my favorite childhood snack back in Korea but I don&#039;t know how to make it. I think it&#039;s almost the same as the gim except that I need to steam the peppers with the rice flower, then dehydrated it? Please help! Thank you for allowing me to learn how to cook Korean food and share the heritage with my family.",

          "text": "Dear Maangchi, I have been following your blog for some time with great interest. I am a second generation Korean born in Germany married to a German husband with three children. After my mother passed away 17 years ago I was craving for her fabulous Korean dishes I grew up with. I used to buy Korean recipe books every time I went to the US. After discovering your blog I was thrilled because it made my quest for Korean food even easier. Thank you for doing such a great job here! You have no idea what it means to me and my family who enjoy my cooking. After watching the video on Gim-Bugak I remembered a dish my grandmother, who passed away in 1993, used to make. When visiting her in Seoul as a child I watched her kneel in front of a huge line of bamboo mats on the top of the roof of my aunts&#039; house in the hot summer sun. She was pasting all the Gim lined up with a spicy red chili pepper soy sauce mixture (probably, since I was a child I only remember the flavor not really knowing what it was). I believe after it was air dried in the sun it was fried. My question is do you have any idea what this was, what the dish is called and if so could you maybe post a recipe of this? I would be very glad and grateful. :-)",

It&#039;s such a familiar scene for me. Yes, I know what you are talking about! it&#039;s called gochujang gim-bugak. Just add some gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste) to the white rice paste and put it on the seaweed paper and dry it out.",
