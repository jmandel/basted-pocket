      "description": "This warm salad of garlicky shrimp and herby chickpeas comes together in just 15 minutes and requires very little effort. Canned chickpeas, Fresno chiles, parsley and red onion get a quick marinade in a creamy citrus dressing while the shrimp cooks in a little garlic and olive oil. Fresno chile adds a little heat, but if you’re sensitive to spice, you can remove the membranes and seeds before adding the chile to the salad. Make the dish your own by adding arugula, or swap the parsley for cilantro or the shrimp for scallops. Serve warm with a hunk of crusty bread, and enjoy leftovers straight from the fridge the next day with a squeeze of lime or lemon juice.",

This made a delightful Sunday supper. \n\nBe sure to allow plenty of time for your chickpeas to marinate. I used an assortment of garden herbs, scallions, and a newly dug garlic bulb so young the cloves weren’t papered yet. \n\nThe local grocery had fresh corn which I cut off the cob and cooked in the pan after the shrimp were finished. It rounded out the dish quite well.",

      "description": "This warm salad of garlicky shrimp and herby chickpeas comes together in just 15 minutes and requires very little effort. Canned chickpeas, Fresno chiles, parsley and red onion get a quick marinade in a creamy citrus dressing while the shrimp cooks in a little garlic and olive oil. Fresno chile adds a little heat, but if you’re sensitive to spice, you can remove the membranes and seeds before adding the chile to the salad. Make the dish your own by adding arugula, or swap the parsley for cilantro or the shrimp for scallops. Serve warm with a hunk of crusty bread, and enjoy leftovers straight from the fridge the next day with a squeeze of lime or lemon juice.",
