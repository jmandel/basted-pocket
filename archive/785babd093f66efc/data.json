When the mixture is a dark tea color (expect faint smoking), turn off the heat and keep the pan on the burner. Let the caramelization continue until the mixture is burgundy in color, 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn off the heat and let rest 5 minutes, uncovered, to concentrate flavors. Taste and add up to 1 1/2 teaspoons of fish sauce or 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, or both, as needed for a pleasant savory-sweet finish. Transfer to a shallow bowl for serving. Invite diners to halve the eggs themselves. If you’d like spicy heat, gently smash the chiles in individual dishes for dipping sauce with some sauce from the pot, and use it to dip the pork and egg or to drizzle into the bowls. "

My only comment would be NOT to add the hard boiled eggs to the pan before serving - this is just going to overcook the eggs. If you want creamy, buttery yolks (and you do). Boil your eggs for 6 minutes, cool under cold water, peel and set aside until ready to serve. \n\nAlso, definitely make the stir-fried greens (i used bok choy & broccoli rabe)",

It’s fine if you want to do it, but it will turn this into a completely different dish, making it even richer than it already is with the pork and eggs. If you don’t have coconut water, I suggest swapping regular water, or slightly sweetened water. That’s more like what a Vietnamese cook would do, and closer to coconut water than coconut milk.",

Fine if that’s what you want but as he stated, a completely different dish. And actually my mom has always used coconut soda (such as coco rico brand) which further tenderizes the pork. And as someone else mentioned, the egg yolks are NOT meant to be soft and jammy… the egg should soak up the flavors of the sauce. In fact, your whites should be brown once you’re done cooking.",

You should only use a fatty portion of the pig since you need the fat to provide the richness you need as well as to prevent the pork from tasting dry and tough when it’s finished. Eggs do indeed go in early in the cooking since it’s not about the runny egg yolks but all about it cooking in the sauce and soaking up the flavor. As for coconut milk, I would not use it as it would add too much fat and unctuousness.",
