So I added 2 tbsp sake, 1 tbsp mirin to the broth (waiting to see if it could use soy sauce also.) also I added equal amount of sliced cremini to the shiitake, and I only wish I had thought to include some parsnip or carrot at the beginning. It could definitely benefit also from a clove or two of minced garlic, and ginger in the broth as well",

You need high-fat salmon to get the nice flakes; otherwise, it will dry out. Overall the recipe is a good start but needs modification.",

      "description": "This warming dish is inspired by Japanese ochazuke, a comforting bowl of rice with green tea poured on top. Traditionally, the meal may also be finished with grilled fish, sashimi or other toppings, but there is room for variation: You could swap out the hot tea for dashi, broth or other liquids. In this approach, the salmon is slow-roasted — which helps render some of the fat and keeps the fish meltingly tender — while a light shiitake mushroom and leek broth simmers. Divide cooked rice among bowls, spoon the salmon and vegetable broth on top, and finish with fresh ginger and a drizzle of sesame oil.",
