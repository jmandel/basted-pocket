Adding 1/4 cup of water to this recipe would have yielded a dough at nearly 80% hydration which is on the higher end. An 80% hydration dough (depending of the success of gluten development) would look anything from a soft, silky, stretchy dough to a gloppy mess.\n\nThe recipe as written, would yield a dough just under 60% hydration which is typical of sweet roll doughs. 60% hydration is the sweet spot for a manageable and versatile dough. Not sticky after mixing and will take a good shaping when properly relaxed.\n\nI’m a full-time baker and would highly recommend using a scale to measure out ingredients. Baking is much more of an exact science than most expect, Happy Baking!",

      "description": "Crackly fried Chinese scallion pancakes take the form of baked buns here, crisp on the sesame-speckled outside and tender within. Sizzling scallions in hot oil captures the aroma of the pancakes and brings out scallions’ savory side while preserving their bright green hue. To mimic the pancakes’ scaffolding, the blend is spiraled into a simple yeast dough, subtly sweet and a little buttery. Be sure to bake them right before serving so you can pull apart the hot, soft layers and inhale the fragrant steam before taking a bite.",
