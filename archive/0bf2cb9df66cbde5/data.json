And the recipe worked at 6200’, where baking is complicated. \n\nI used Meyer lemon zest and rose water for flavor. Didn’t have an 8” pan, so I used a 9” pan and increased the ingredients by a quarter. Of course then I didn’t have enough cream cheese, so I used more Creme fraîche. Did have a crack on the top, so I inverted it, and decorated with almond slivers and confectioner’s sugar.",

This version was perfect! I topped it with raspberry whipped cream. Everyone loved it! I'll be making this recipe again and again.",

      "description": "Japanese cheesecakes, sometimes called soufflé or cotton cheesecakes, have a melt-in-the-mouth texture that’s like a classic cheesecake crossed with an ethereal sponge cake. This one, adapted from Joanne Chang of Boston’s Flour Bakery, has bright lemon tanginess and crème fraîche richness as well. It’s best made the day before you plan to serve it, and will keep for up to 4 days in the refrigerator. Serve it plain and minimalist, with a sprinkle of confectioners’ sugar on top, or with fresh berries for added color and juiciness.",
