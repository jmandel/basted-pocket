Now, I add it, right after I add the onions to the pan, sauté for a minute or two, then add cauliflower and a little bit of water, give it a good stir, and cover the pan.",

Cumin, chile and Sichuan peppercorns are used generously, resulting in bold, not-for-the-faint-of-heart dishes that combine Chinese and Middle Eastern flavors. This recipe, which is adapted from “To Asia, With Love” by Hetty McKinnon, is a vegan riff on the signature lamb dish at Xi’an Famous Foods, a restaurant chain in New York, that is made with chunks of meat dry-fried in a heavy cumin spice mix. This version features tofu and cauliflower.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for The Veggie newsletter.",
