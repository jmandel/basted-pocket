Used 1 TBL “La Dallia” (picante) pimentón de la Vera (Amazon) which took 3 days to settle into the stew, but when it did it was absolutely spectacular! Two pounds of lamb shoulder (with bones--fished them out at the end) was perfect proportion with the Cannellini beans. Thank you Chef Willoughby for this gift!",

I used about a cup and a half of inexpensive red wine and probably only a cup of chicken broth because that’s all I had.  Never put the beans in coz I forgot.  Came out gloriously and so fast and easy (40 mins in the pressure cooker). Save yourself all the trouble of browning the meat and all the rest and just enjoy!",

Then I baked a cake and put it back in the oven at 200F for a few more hours. Moreover, after browning the lamb and veggies, I put the stew in a large tagine.  I think that made it extra moist and tender.  I also agree that a good quality hot paprika is key for this recipe.",

I made this numerous times over the winter, using pimenton de la vera picante and--when the Park Slope Coop had them--real Spanish fabada beans (soaked overnight and precooked), to great accolades. This great stew really lends itself to a long simmer in a slow cooker, until you want to add the beans and eat.",

I also threw in a bunch of sugar snap peas along with the parsley -- at the very end, after taking it off the heat -- so that by serving time the peas were bright green and still firm to the bite. Perfect counterpart to the richness of what is really more a soup than a stew. Delicious!",
