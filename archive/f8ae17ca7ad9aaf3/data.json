I cooked the pasta in a smaller quantity of water (just enough to cover the pasta) which concentrates the starch in the pasta water and makes for a nice creamy sauce. Important to not salt the water too heavily, as it boils down and concentrates the salt content. Didn’t cook the miso with pasta as directed. Finished the pasta to al dente in the pan with the mushrooms and leeks and a bit of pasta water, then stirred in only half a cup of water mixed with the miso, cheese and parsley off the heat.

A woodsy, umami-packed flavour. Mmmmmmm. I used a non-stick pan: for the mushrooms to “roast” (shiitake for me), one MUST leave them alone and stir every 2 minutes, as specified. The parmesan should not clump if semi-evenly distributed and  pasta “tossed” as for a salad, with fork or spatula and wooden spoon. Fantastico! Buon appetito.",

This caused the mushrooms to give up a TON of water in the pot, and while I managed to reduce the liquid down, the mushrooms never got as brown as they probably should have. Next time I’ll just stick with the more meaty mushrooms instead of regular supermarket white mushrooms.",

Sautéed leeks and mushrooms form the core flavors of the pasta, but it is the addition of miso that completes the dish: Whisked with the starchy pasta water and grated Parmesan, it forms a quick sauce to coat the noodles. A farro, spelt or whole-wheat pasta would nicely complement the earthy flavors of this dish.",
