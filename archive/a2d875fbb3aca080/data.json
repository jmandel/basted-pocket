Your crispy chicken recipe led me here :-) (It&#039;s all because of Yoon Doo-Joon enjoying it so much in &quot;Let&#039;s Eat 2&quot;). I was wondering, if you usually eat the Bibimbap with the vegetable Banchan when they are cold and they become a little bit warm again with the steamed rice OR should I serve the Bibimbap quickly, when the vegetables are still hot? How about the Banchan in general? Do you usually eat them right out of the fridge? I am confused which to reheat, which to eat cold and which to serve only one time. Thank you!",

          "text": "For the veggies, I don&#039;t use zucchini; red bell pepper; gosari (fernbrakes); and doraji (bellflower roots) here. I don&#039;t think doraji is imported to our country. For the gosari, my mom once ever said if ferns are difficult to handle. Wrong cooking method could result in poisoning. And also I think that the one you use is different from the fernbrakes in our country (it&#039;s always green after cook, never turned brownish or even blackish). So to keep the color balanced, I replace the doraji with oyster mushrooms since they have the same color and look. With the same reason, I replace the gosari with wood ear mushroom. Sometimes, I replace the spinach with fresh lettuce (I&#039;ve ever watched it once on a Korean variety show). For the protein, I use chicken or sauteed sausage instead. Since I can&#039;t eat raw egg because of the Salmonella, I turn the egg into gyeran jidan to keep the beautiful color (here is the picture ^^)",

          "text": "Hi Nora, i read your article and it says that your fernbrake is always green and your worried about not being prepared right. I lived in Korea for about four years and i spent a lot of time out in the country where i wittnessed the harvesting and preparation of the ferns. First the folks would pick the young curly shoots and fill lots of bags, carry them home and they were set out in the sun to dry. After a day or so the fern cuttings would turn brown. They would then pack them up in portion size or in a basket and hang them up in storage shed. The rest was simple usally just soak them in water untill ready for the what ever recipie they were using. As for the species im not sure about the ones in your country, but here in the United states in particular in Oregon, Upstate New York and northern parts the Korean folks go out the woods and pick bags full of these fern. Good luck let me know how it turns out.",

So, I&#039;ve decided to post my modification version (joesonghamnida, Maangchi-ssi ^^) for the gochujang and veggies. I mix 1 red chilli pepper, 3 cloves shallot, 2 cloves garlic, 1 candlenut, and ginger (about 1 cm in length). Sautee the mixture with 1 tbsp of vegetable oil, a bay leaf, a pinch of salt, a pinch of white pepper powder, 50 ml of water, and 1 tbsp of sweet soy sauce until the water reduced and the mixture gets its viscosity back.",

          "text": "I&#039;ve followed your cooking website for about one year now, Maangchi-ssi. I was celebrating my birthday party at a Korean restaurant and ordered a dolsot bibimbab. I couldn&#039;t forget the taste and really wanted to make it multiple times once I&#039;m home. I was searching the internet for how bibimbab is prepared, and then found this astonishing website. So, the first recipe I tried was this bibimbab. But, I rarely want to comment or post any photos because I always make a lot of modifications. I need to adjust the taste with our daily tongue. Besides, Korean spices and ingredients are difficult and expensive to buy too back then",

          "text": "Thank you Maangchi! You introduced me to amazing Korean food, gave me courage to go into a local Korean market, and to order from their Cafe, which is very traditional. I think about ordering from them everyday, but limit myself to once a week. Today I finally prepared my very own bibimpap and I even turned it into food prep for the upcoming week! All I need is to add a fried egg and a scoop of gochugaru and my lunch is ready!",
