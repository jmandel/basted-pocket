Next time, which might be tomorrow because craving more already, I’ll make meatballs a tad smaller - I had ended up with 18, and I’ll make sure all my feta is crumbled well - I originally ignored some of the bigger pieces.

I would do ground turkey instead of chicken and ensure it's lean. DEFINITELY go for homemade broth... I did bouillon paste and it was way too salty... I liked the idea of this recipe (and it must be me with the amount of positive reviews) but I thought this was super disappointing. I love NYT Cooking and I now have a challenge to do a new recipe a week. Last week lentils, bitter greens and egg was amazing but this is a hard miss on a remake for me.",

The oats disappear, but make the broth a tiny bit thicker, but still “brothy”.  I used kale as it gets less slimy and reheats really well.  An extra half a lemon. Great soup!",

First time grating a red onion; not an easy task (for me), so I ended up mincing and that was fine. Recipe is a keeper.\n\nThank you NYT Cooking and commenters for helping me learn to cook (I’m over 50)!",

Going forward, I may keep the orzo in the soup if i happen to not have enough oatmeal(which is what happened today) but I will not bake the meatballs - it made them tough. Cooking them in the soup/ dutch oven created a lovely moist soft meatball that was easy to eat and balanced solely with the broth.",

The meatballs, made with ground chicken, feta and fresh dill, swim in a lemony, spinach-filled broth that’s comforting and light, perfect for lunch or dinner.
