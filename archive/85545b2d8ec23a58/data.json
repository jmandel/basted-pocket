Chopped cabbage gets a nice char in butter that browns as it cooks, adding richness to the lean vegetable. Fast-cooking ground pork is infused with garlic, ginger and scallions, and the final addition of salty fish sauce, bright lime juice and chopped fresh cilantro creates a punchy sauce. If you like a jolt of heat, use a thinly sliced bird’s-eye chile in place of the crushed red pepper.",

My two additions/alterations for next time will be\n\n- use a wok or heavy bottom skillet as cabbage really needs to be done at a blazing heat so the internal sugars can char and caramelize without it getting soggy\n- add light brown sugar (or palm sugar if you have it) when adding the cabbage or at the end to balance the flavor. It was desperately needing a sweet note. \n\nOverall, a very nice, straightforward, low effort, minimal cleanup dish. Perfect for a weeknight. Will report back when I try the updates.

A single tablespoon of fish sauce is very salty, but it is  not enough for the whole dish, so it is important to add a bit of salt at the other stages as indicated. Next time I might try using oil only instead of butter, whose flavour might have been overwhelmed by the jalapeno.",

Tip: don't be shy about the lime juice and fish sauce - they really sing here, and blend nicely with the buttery sauteed cabbage. 5/5",

      "description": "This quick, weeknight cabbage and pork stir-fry is humble in ingredients yet packed with flavor, thanks to briny fish sauce, rich brown butter and potent aromatics (ginger, garlic and red-pepper flakes). Chopped cabbage gets a nice char in butter that browns as it cooks, adding richness to the lean vegetable. Fast-cooking ground pork is infused with garlic, ginger and scallions, and the final addition of salty fish sauce, bright lime juice and chopped fresh cilantro creates a punchy sauce. If you like a jolt of heat, use a thinly sliced bird’s-eye chile in place of the crushed red pepper.",
