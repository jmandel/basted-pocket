The juice is perfect for weeknight cooking, when shortcuts to big flavor are key, and it adds a subtle, briny backbone to any broth. This broth is also infused with rich shiitake mushrooms, aromatic garlic and a generous boost of bright ginger. Pearl couscous gets toasted before boiling, adding nutty notes to the soup. It also contributes delightful chewiness, but other small pastas like ditalini or orzo are also good substitutes, though cook time may need to be adjusted accordingly.",

After reading the notes, I added 2 T of yellow miso paste to the clam juice and water, but I was underwhelmed the first night. Leftovers the next day were much more flavorful! I’m thinking that instead of water, I’d use mushroom broth or veggie stock, and add a 1/2 cup of white wine into the mushrooms, onion, garlic, and ginger.",

I used spinach instead of peas because I hate peas, but then found it was missing the sweetness so I added a small amount of honey.

      "description": "In this recipe, tender, flaky cod is poached in a light, flavorful broth that optimizes bottled clam juice, a versatile yet underused ingredient. The juice is perfect for weeknight cooking, when shortcuts to big flavor are key, and it adds a subtle, briny backbone to any broth. This broth is also infused with rich shiitake mushrooms, aromatic garlic and a generous boost of bright ginger. Pearl couscous gets toasted before boiling, adding nutty notes to the soup. It also contributes delightful chewiness, but other small pastas like ditalini or orzo are also good substitutes, though cook time may need to be adjusted accordingly.",
