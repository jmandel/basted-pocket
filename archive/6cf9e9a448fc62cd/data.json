          "text": "I&#039;ve made it with baby spinach and with regular spinach. You can do both but the adult spinach is better, in my opinion. The baby spinach is soft and you just end up with slimy wads in each bite, whereas the adult is firmer and has the stems, which create a very nice texture for this recipe. But if you only have baby spinach on hand, I wouldn&#039;t let that deter you from making this, especially if you are planning on adding it to kimbap or something like that.",

Sweet potatoes are related to morning glory plants, and the vines have a fair amount of latex in them, but the leaves don&#039;t have as much. The resulting dish looks similar to the sigeumchi-namul with spinach, but the texture is a bit . . . mushy. There is a kind of slimy component to the leaves. I cannot recommend it.",

          "text": "Hi, Maangchi! I got a question for u. I always make different namul during the week. Sometimes when i only got bits of leftover meat dish and my various namul, i just throw them all in a big bowl of rice, mixed them all up+gyeran jang jorim and some sesame oil (since most of my meat dishes usually eaten by my son got gochujang in it) and sometimes i also add dried doljaban i bought from the store. Is this ok? Whenever my mom saw me eat my bibimbap of leftovers, she always shake her head and ask how is it that I&#039;m not as fat as a pig ready for slaughter. I feel bad if i have to throw away those bits of food. Most of my leftover meat are 2-3 days old and my namul i are just a 12hrs old max. It&#039;s just sometimes when my son finished all the rice for the day, i ended up being too lazy to cook more rice for dinner and most of the time ended up munching on those namul without rice. So the following day when i cook fresh rice, i cook enough for my bibimbap that i usually eat for my lunch. I work at home. Please enlighten the ignorant me. Thanks, Ima",

          "text": "Hi Maangchi, What is the best type of spinach to use for this recipe? I noticed the prepared side dishes that we get from the Korean Market or restaurants in Sunnyvale (nearby &quot;Korea town&quot;) the spinach seems to be a unique variety. It looks like it has small unopened flowers, and is attached to a stalk (and the stalk itself is pretty tender). In fact the market labels it &quot;seasoned edible&quot; so I am not even sure if it is actually spinach. I tried making this dish with organic baby spinach but it definitely was not the same. This is one of our favorite banchan and its so easy to make, I would like to try growing the veggie in our backyard garden this winter. It seems like it has such a mild flavor that it would probably be good in smoothies too. Thank you! Rich",

          "text": "I know this is an old comment, but this sounds like a Chinese vegetable that I see in the Korean market near me. It is sold as &quot;Yu Choy&quot; and it has tender leaves, fat succulent stems, and tiny flowerbuds. Sometimes one or two buds has opened to show a yellow flower with 4 petals, like a rocket or cress flower. So I think it is more related to broccoli than to spinach, but its leaves cook up like spinach, so it is probably perfect for this dish.",

Then the next morning, bring out of the fridge and put it in a thermo flask and bring to work to eat for lunch. Will the dish turn bad? Do u advise I warm it up in the microwave before putting it in the thermo flask as I have rice at a serparate lower level in the thermo flask, my worry is that the heat from the rice might spoil the cold spinach although the rice and spinach is put in separate container. P.S. my thermo flask have 3 containers for rice/ vege / meat/ soup and to be stack neatly into the thermo flask. How bout the other side dish, can it be kept overnight in the fridge? It will be great if most side dish can be kept overnight so I dont have to wake up that early to cook and rush out for work. sorry for the lengthy post ~",
