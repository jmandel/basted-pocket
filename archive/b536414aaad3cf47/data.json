      "description": "Grilling asparagus brings out its natural sweetness and adds delightful charred notes. Here, the asparagus is doused in a salty, nutty and umami-rich olive, pine nut and miso dressing. This recipe calls to cook the asparagus in a grill pan, but you can instead opt for a cast-iron skillet or set your asparagus on an outdoor grill. You can also achieve similar flavor by popping the asparagus into the broiler or roasting at the highest temperature your oven can reach. A touch of dill adds a fragrant note, enhancing the overall aroma of the dish, but feel free to omit, or use other soft herbs that you have on hand, like chives. Eat alongside a roast chicken, or incorporate into a spring salad spread.",

After starting step 3, I thought it might be better to brown the pine nuts before cooking with the olives, but I did it as written and it worked. The sauce is strong (even with mild Castelvetrano olives) and flavorful, so a little goes a long way. Use sparingly and you will enjoy it. Grilled asparagus is not as subtle as steamed, so this sauce works with it.",

I did make slight alterations, as I added a bit extra olive brine and lemon to the dressing- just cause I personally like things a bit acidic. I also had garlic I’d already chopped on hand and included that. Out of this world delicious.\n\nWe had very thick asparagus vs thin stalks, so I think that helped it hold up to this sauce.

      "description": "Grilling asparagus brings out its natural sweetness and adds delightful charred notes. Here, the asparagus is doused in a salty, nutty and umami-rich olive, pine nut and miso dressing. This recipe calls to cook the asparagus in a grill pan, but you can instead opt for a cast-iron skillet or set your asparagus on an outdoor grill. You can also achieve similar flavor by popping the asparagus into the broiler or roasting at the highest temperature your oven can reach. A touch of dill adds a fragrant note, enhancing the overall aroma of the dish, but feel free to omit, or use other soft herbs that you have on hand, like chives. Eat alongside a roast chicken, or incorporate into a spring salad spread.",
