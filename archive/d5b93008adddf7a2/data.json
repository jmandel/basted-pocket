To add protein and because it is perfect in this dish, add tofu. I find it best to add it after all the broth ingredients have been stirred into the tomatoes. I use a 1/2 package of extra firm tofu (8 oz), cubed. I keep a pitcher of cold water in the fridge so I didn't have to mess with the chipped ice.",

Today, for instance, I wanted to pre-make some desk lunches for the coming week.

I also added a half pound of poached shrimp to give it a little protein.  It was fantastic.  My husband loved it as well.  Great summer week-night meal!  I also cooked the noodles ahead of time and put them in the fridge, so it was also quick to make.",
