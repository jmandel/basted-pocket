In this recipe, chicken thighs are slow seared using a technique from the chef Paul Bertolli called “bottom-up cooking” where the chicken cooks almost entirely on the skin side over moderate heat, resulting in shatteringly crisp skin. The gentle sputtering sound that signals the release of moisture from the chicken hitting the hot fat in the pan stops when the meat is fully cooked and the skin crisp and evenly browned. A quick pan sauce of chicken stock, lime juice and maple syrup, made glossy with a few pats of butter, completes this dish.",

        "transcript": "\"The taste and aroma of home cooking.\" What is the taste and aroma of home cooking to you guys? “A fresh pot of rice.” “Rice. Just rice. Just the smell of rice.” “Also rice.” We’re all Asian in this room. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, my name is Eric Kim. I’m a cooking columnist for The New York Times. And today, we’re making crispy chicken with lime butter. Today, I’m going to teach you a technique I think produces the absolute best chicken at home. We’re really, really rendering that chicken fat that just really guarantees crispy skin. It’s very easy. It’s very simple, but it requires technique and finesse, and it requires your attention. [MUSIC PLAYING] All this happens entirely on the stove top and the skillet over like very moderate heat, medium, medium low. We’re going to salt and pepper this and let it sit for like 5 to 10 minutes. The salt’s going to draw out a little bit of moisture before it goes in the pan. I like to pat it dry right before it goes in the pan. See, it’s only been like a few seconds, but you can already see the water drawing out. I’m going to pat it dry now. It’s going to be in that pan for a very long time on the skin side. So it’s going to have time to really render out the fat and remove moisture. This step just really ensures that you get a head start. It’s worth doing. The thing about stainless steel skillets, in order to create a non-stick surface, we are going to heat it first, medium, medium low, not very high. When I add the oil to the heated pan, you’ll see how immediately it just floats on top because it’s nonstick. I like this because it really creates a nice bond. You could use a cast iron skillet if you want. Same thing. See how it is loose already? The oil is dancing on top. So I’d just like to lay it in. To get them to all fit, have the bone side the thick bone side facing outward and then the little flabby skin part facing inward. You don’t have to be that precious about it, but I’m precious so. See, it’s already not sticking. To be honest, this heat is too high for me. I’m going to lower it because, again, I want this to go for 20 minutes. I’m going to wash my hands again. So this is where you can just really nurse it. You hear that sound, right, the sizzling sound? That’s going to really quiet down once it’s done. If you find that the skin is already like blackening before the chicken’s even been in here for that long, then that’s when you want to lower the heat. You can look at it. Like see, it’s already pretty good, right? But we’re going to just keep going for a really long time. This is like fried chicken but no batter. I’m ready to flip. Don’t be fooled by the quiet sound. That oil is still so hot. In fact, it’s hotter than before. Gorgeous. “Wow.” Thanks. Love having an audience. And then this just cooks for five more minutes, or until the internal temperature is 180. Dark meat needs to go to 180 for it to really fall apart from the bone and be fully cooked in a way that’s pleasurable to eat. So to build the pan sauce, I do want to get the garlic started a little bit in the fat, and it’s going to season the fat. I like to crush the garlic. Just with the back of my knife I’m like [VOCALIZING]:. So this has been going for three minutes. I’m going to let it go for the full five. And then I might make the bigger guy kind of hang out a little longer. Doesn’t it look like roast chicken? Because we did it entirely in the pan it has this beautiful, even browning. I’m really proud of that. I’m feeling pretty smug about it, actually. I’m going to take out the small pieces. Where the oil is, is where the pan is the hottest. So I put the things that I don’t want to cook as much on the top part. It’s almost like a grill where you’re using the surface that you have to your advantage. And what you have here now, it’s like mostly chicken fat. This chicken’s going to taste chicken-y as heck. We’re ready to build the pan sauce now. So the chicken’s out of the pan. And now, we have the beautiful garlic. However, I don’t want all of this fat. I want about 3 tablespoons. So I’m going to take out a good amount. And this is -- I hate when people say liquid gold. This is liquid copper. Just kidding. You really want to save the chicken fat. It’s great to fry an egg into. It’s great as butter for toast. I like buttering toast with it. So yeah, that’s about 3 tablespoons, I would say. So into here 1/2 a cup of chicken stock. Water works as well. We’re just trying to pick up all the fun, the flavorful bits at the bottom. 2 tablespoons of lime juice. 2 teaspoons of maple syrup. Use honey if you want. You can use a pinch of sugar if you want. And we’re going to bring this up to a boil. A little sugar also adds body to the final sauce. You get a shininess, a glossiness, a thickness because of the sugar. We’re going to reduce this by about half. That’s so good. It’s so stupid how good that is. A little salt, little pepper, fresh pepper. You can actually turn off the heat completely. I’m just going to lower it and add the butter. You can keep it at a simmer. And I’m just going to really agitate the pan. And once the butter is melted, the sauce is done. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let’s eat. Let’s try one of these. Even the sauced portion is still crispy. This is what I like to show people. The skin can come off in one piece. It’s because that underside has been rendered so well. The pan sauce, it’s so balanced. It tastes so much of the chicken, but there’s a lot of acid from the lime. There’s a little caramelly flavor from the butter. You’re kind of really bringing out the best of the ingredients. So go forth and make chicken. We have some of that chicken fat. This is like when you’re alone and no one’s watching.",

I must say, even though the whole place smelled like chicken fat (could be worse) and the cleanup was an ordeal, the crust and flavor was way more of a restaurant quality meal than I ever have had baking in oven, which yields a thinner less crispy skin.   I always use Better Than Bullion mixed with water for recipes calling for such a small amount of stock, and it came out excellent.    As delish as this was, I think it’s a one-off due to smoke/mess/super high fat quotient.   Very good recipe and excellent flavor of sauce too.

In this recipe, chicken thighs are slow seared using a technique from the chef Paul Bertolli called “bottom-up cooking” where the chicken cooks almost entirely on the skin side over moderate heat, resulting in shatteringly crisp skin. The gentle sputtering sound that signals the release of moisture from the chicken hitting the hot fat in the pan stops when the meat is fully cooked and the skin crisp and evenly browned. A quick pan sauce of chicken stock, lime juice and maple syrup, made glossy with a few pats of butter, completes this dish.",
