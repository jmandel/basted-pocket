I used unsweetened flaked coconut and it was plenty sweet for us.  I might try reducing the about of butter in the topping a bit next time.  That’s not for a calorie thing but because it was more runny and I felt like it puddled on the sides a bit (because the cake was a little domed). I was glad I had left the parchment paper go up the sides of the cake (but don’t leave much poking up because that could catch fire under the broiler). Or I might poke holes in the top of the cake or let the topping sit and thicken a bit as the butter cools. Oh, and do try to keep the cake level by walking it up the sides of the pan after you pour the batter in. I didn’t but will next time - and there will be a next time!  \nPS - if you don’t know what I mean by walking the batter up the side of the pan: tilt the pan and roll the batter around the entire outside of the pan to create a “high water mark” that gives the cake something to climb on in the oven as it rises. I always do that for tiered cakes and quick breads but didn’t think of it here.",

Then the whole cake, still in its pan, is run under the broiler until the brown sugar melts, turning fudgy, and the coconut toasts and singes in spots. It makes for a lovely treat that keeps well, too. The topping, brittle and crunchy on the day it’s baked, gets softer and creamier after sitting at room temperature overnight, where it will last for three days.",
