I recommend sprinkling a little bit more of the Panko breadcrumbs on top of the miso/butter mixture, for a little extra crunch. We even broiled the top of the fish for about 60 seconds after it was done cooking Even with different thicknesses of cod, it worked out perfectly at 16 minutes, using a meat thermometer to 145 to 149 temp. I also recommend increasing the ginger and garlic, it’s such a lovely flavor. It needed a little more oomph!",

Prior to baking, I coated the filets in the panko.   The fish was very flavorful and the panko crust crispy.  Served with green beans in oyster sauce and red pepper flakes.   Delicious!",

It pairs particularly well with ginger and garlic, and is combined here with those aromatics, butter and panko bread crumbs for a crisp coating. As it bakes, the miso crust caramelizes and forms an addictive flavor that elevates the mild cod.",
