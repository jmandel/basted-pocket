I also think I would’ve preferred the salad on the side, which is funny because I usually love mixing all my food together. I just felt like the salad was so bright and delicious on its own, and adding it on top of the beans masked its vibrancy. I’ll consider making it again with the combo of Greek yogurt and low-fat milk another commenter recommended, and probably half the oil. I’d also try it with sun-dried tomatoes rehydrated with hot water instead of oil-packed to cut down on excess fat. I’m not sure I’d add the Parmesan to the beans, either—I couldn’t taste it over the cream.",

Pumpkin seeds add fiber, polyunsatured fats, and 5 more grams of protein per serve but still make it creamy.

Inspired by the flavors of red pesto, this recipe calls for simmering cannellini beans with staple ingredients like onion, garlic, crushed red pepper, tomato paste and heavy cream, as well as sun-dried tomatoes and salty Pecorino, until the results taste complex and rich. Top the beans with a lemony arugula salad that is peppered with fried bread crumbs for a dish that is crunchy, chewy, crispy and creamy in every bite.&nbsp;",
