Coconut cream adds a lovely richness to the vinaigrette while ginger brings a bite and the acidity of rice vinegar and limes deliver a slight pucker. To achieve a nice golden brown caramelization while roasting your vegetables, make sure the cut pieces are dry and spread evenly on the sheet pan. And those fennel fronds — save them! They add a nice licorice flavor to tingle your palate ever so slightly once chopped and tossed over the finished dish.",
