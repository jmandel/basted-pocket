      "description": "This tomato pasta is a testament to simplicity: Just toss all the sauce ingredients into a roasting pan and let the oven — and pool of olive oil — gently simmer and “confit” the rest while you prepare your pasta. The stars of this dish are the ancho chile, slowly releasing a subtle smoky spice as it softens in the oil, and the strips of lemon peel, which sweeten as they cook. Heirloom tomatoes add wonderful fragrance and variety, as some break down into the sauce while others remain firm, adding textural contrast. This recipe is incredibly versatile: Swap the ancho chile for a long red chile and a teaspoon of smoked paprika, for example, or use other types of tomatoes if they are easier to come by. Foolproof in method and bursting with flavor, this dish is a perfect addition to any midweek repertoire.",

Having no ancho chiles, I doubled the tomato paste and used chili powder! Oregano? Dried from a bottle. Ditto with a sprinkling of cinnamon powder because I couldn’t find the sticks I swear I have somewhere. Instead of olive oil, I chopped up a good 10 ounces of raw bacon and sprinkled it over the tomatoes. Did it work? Yes! Delicious. Very forgiving recipe. You can wing it. Oh—and I didn’t save enough pasta water, so I used half-and-half to loosen the sauce. I know, I know—it’s hardly the original recipe, but it was great. I love recipes that are so forgiving with substitutions.",

I agree with other reviews that there is a lot of oil being used here (at the end it felt like the tomatoes were swimming in it) but it was very easy to separate, even as the tomatoes were becoming mushy and sauce-like. If I were using pasta I would add the confit to the pasta rather than the other way around so you can control the amount of oil you’re using. \n\nNone of my grocery stores carried whole dried ancho chilies so I used ground ancho chili powder and it came out great. I was light handed with it (used 1tsp) but I could have used more and it would have providing a smokier flavor.",

I made it with GF pasta (Bionaturae) which seemed to absorb the sauce nicely so no need for the pasta water.  All in all a very tasty pasta dish worth trying again.",

      "description": "This tomato pasta is a testament to simplicity: Just toss all the sauce ingredients into a roasting pan and let the oven — and pool of olive oil — gently simmer and “confit” the rest while you prepare your pasta. The stars of this dish are the ancho chile, slowly releasing a subtle smoky spice as it softens in the oil, and the strips of lemon peel, which sweeten as they cook. Heirloom tomatoes add wonderful fragrance and variety, as some break down into the sauce while others remain firm, adding textural contrast. This recipe is incredibly versatile: Swap the ancho chile for a long red chile and a teaspoon of smoked paprika, for example, or use other types of tomatoes if they are easier to come by. Foolproof in method and bursting with flavor, this dish is a perfect addition to any midweek repertoire.",
