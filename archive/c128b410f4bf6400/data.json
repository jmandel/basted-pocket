      "description": "This cozy dessert from Sara Mardanbigi and Edgar Rico, the owners of Nixta Taqueria in Austin, Texas, is a take on sholeh zard, a loose, heavily spiced Persian rice pudding Ms. Mardanbigi grew up eating. It also borrows influence from the Mexican arroz con leche of Mr. Rico’s childhood. Their take is warm and smoky with black cardamom and saffron, velvety from egg yolks and butter, and has a savory finish. It calls for arborio rice instead of the usual basmati to add a slight chew, and strawberry powder instead of rosewater to provide similar floral notes with a punch of acid.",

If you want to make a vegan version boil water and add jasmine rice (cups 1rice:4water)  until the rice is so soft when you eat it you feel little to no grain. After that add rose water and sugar to taste and saffron till you have a vibrant yellow color. Also add about a tablespoon of unsalted butter (optional), cardamon is typically added but I don't add it and it's perfcect. Finish with almonds pistachio, and cinnamon.",

Traditional sholeh zard doesn’t have any dairy or eggs. jasmine rice, salt, sugar, saffron, unsalted butter, cardamom, rose water, ground cinnamon and slivered almonds for topping. You can Google the recipe - so yummy and a more traditional texture (this one looks soupy).",

      "description": "This cozy dessert from Sara Mardanbigi and Edgar Rico, the owners of Nixta Taqueria in Austin, Texas, is a take on sholeh zard, a loose, heavily spiced Persian rice pudding Ms. Mardanbigi grew up eating. It also borrows influence from the Mexican arroz con leche of Mr. Rico’s childhood. Their take is warm and smoky with black cardamom and saffron, velvety from egg yolks and butter, and has a savory finish. It calls for arborio rice instead of the usual basmati to add a slight chew, and strawberry powder instead of rosewater to provide similar floral notes with a punch of acid.",
