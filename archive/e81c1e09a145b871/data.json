Took a droplet right to the eye(lid, fortunately), and across much of the counter and cabinetry.\nStill, now I know, and I would make this again.

I had 2 Yukon gold potatoes rather than one russet.  After Chopping one potato, I realized that I had no use for the remaining single potato and I added that one also.  I had no stock, so I used artificially chicken flavored soup and seasoning mix.  I puréed it in my 40 year old oster blender. It was smooth and delicious.",

      "description": "This celery-forward soup is in essence a potato-leek soup that substitutes most of the potatoes with brighter celery, and skips the vast quantities of cream in the original, resulting in a lighter flavor and texture. Woodsy herbs like thyme and bay leaves, and fresh, raw parsley give the soup its intensely green, almost grassy taste. It’s worth trying the soup without dairy, then admiring the transformative effect of a splash of crème fraîche or cream, which subdues the louder celery notes.",
