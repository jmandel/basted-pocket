This easy dish works any night of the week, since it comes together in less than half an hour. Maple syrup sweetens the glaze, which gets a savory pop from whole mustard seeds in Dijon. Even though salmon is naturally fatty, a dollop of mayonnaise adds extra richness while thickening the glaze to help it seal onto&nbsp;the fish. The herbaceous aroma of cilantro stems baked into the sauce brightens the dish, as do tender leaves scattered on top.&nbsp;Fill out your feast with any combination of&nbsp;steamed rice, roasted potatoes,&nbsp;green beans&nbsp;or salad.",

My only thought is that a lot of the glaze slid off the fish and wound up in the pan.  I think next time I will put have the glaze on at the beginning and the remainder half way through cooking.  This recipe is a keeper!",

The skin is not crispy and it's useless. I would oil the baking pan just a little before putting salmon in. For two, I used .8 pounds of salmon. Served with smashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. Oh, he likes well-done salmon, so I roasted it about 25 minutes. It was luscious.",

I hadn't thought of baking fresh herbs, so that's a great addition. I'm not a fan of mayonnaise, so I didn't and won't use that. Garlic is also great in the sauce. One thing I really liked from the other recipe is that you can add halved Brussels sprouts that have been tossed in olive oil, salt and pepper to the pan. They take the same amount of time, and then it's a full sheet pan meal.",

      "description": "Salmon baked at a low temperature until medium-rare delivers a silky texture that tastes special enough to make it a festive centerpiece. This easy dish works any night of the week, since it comes together in less than half an hour. Maple syrup sweetens the glaze, which gets a savory pop from whole mustard seeds in Dijon. Even though salmon is naturally fatty, a dollop of mayonnaise adds extra richness while thickening the glaze to help it seal onto&nbsp;the fish. The herbaceous aroma of cilantro stems baked into the sauce brightens the dish, as do tender leaves scattered on top.&nbsp;Fill out your feast with any combination of&nbsp;steamed rice, roasted potatoes,&nbsp;green beans&nbsp;or salad.",
