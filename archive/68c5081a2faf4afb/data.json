      "description": "If you’re someone who loves a dessert packed with fruit and texture, this apple tart is made for you. The double dose of sesame is used in both the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the natural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for a wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes a spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes almost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples. Second, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the tart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. ",

For the crust, I used Pate Sucree, which is a standard sweet crust used in French baking. I also used honey crisp apples so after 50 minutes, the crust was done but apples had a bright crisp flavor, rather than mushy fully cooked apples you find is most apple pie. I used a 9 inch glass pie dish for baking and dropped the dough rolled on parchment paper directly onto the baking dish. I don't think the cardamon flavor was pronounced enough so would add another teaspoon next time. Leftovers were even better the second day.",

          "reviewBody": "Christmas 2024 HIT!!!!  Used the recipe ingredients as written, but altered techniques.  Made the crust & tahini mixture the day before & put it together & baked it in the afternoon for dinner. Used the crust recipe but used the “foolproof butter crust” technique from ATK  & the crust turned out great.  Grate 4 T of the butter & put it in the freezer.  Combine half the flour, sugar & salt in the food processor with 1 stick of cold butter cut into small pieces until it comes together in a ball, about 30 seconds.  Then, break the ball of dough apart and distribute around the bowl of the food processor.  Pulse in the rest of the flour until just combined.  Turn out into a bowl.   Add the frozen grated butter and toss until butter is coated.  Add 2 T cold water and bring together with a rubber spatula.  Then add another 2 T cold water.  Form into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap & rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours.  Rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before rolling out.  Rolls out like a dream.  Nice & flaky.  Crust is my favorite part of any pie.  I weighed my apples & used 4 honey crisp apples to reach 2lbs.  Sliced thinly & microwaved for a couple minutes to get them started cooking.  Baking time at 375 for 55 minutes.  \nThe flavor combination of the tahini mixture & apples is really good.  I served it with creme fraiche and a caramel sauce made with Sagardoa hard cider from an ATK recipe.  Really fabulous.",

I used a mix of honeycrisp (sweeter) and cosmic crisp (more tart). You may also want to take out the chilled dough for 10 minutes before you're ready to roll it out. And if you have a super basic oven like me where things usually take longer, preheat to 400, drop to 375, and bake for 55-60 minutes.",

The sesame filling did turn out bitter for me, so I'm going to see about sourcing a different brand of tahini. The tub I got was freshly opened. I also had to bake for 15-20 minutes longer.

      "description": "If you’re someone who loves a dessert packed with fruit and texture, this apple tart is made for you. The double dose of sesame is used in both the crust and filling, giving a nutty, earthy pop against the natural sweetness of the apples. They get tossed in ground cardamom for a wonderfully sweet, warm scent. Sesame is used twice: First, it becomes a spreadable paste with tahini, butter, sugar and egg, which becomes almost halva-like when combined with the cardamom-scented apples. Second, sesame seeds (and sugar) get sprinkled along the edges of the tart, making for a strikingly beautiful, textured crust. ",
