If, at any time, the water in the saucepan gets low, you can add a bit of hot water from the kettle.

Cook till the mixture thickens at about 165F to 170F/74C to 77C, about 10 to 12 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl with the spatula. The liquid curd should be very thick like a custard. Coat the back of a spoon with the custard, and draw a line with your finger; the line should stay. Remove and transfer the curd to a container. You can also strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth to remove any bits. Press a piece of plastic film on the surface and refrigerate for at least 4 hours until chilled. This curd can be prepared and refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for 3 months.",
