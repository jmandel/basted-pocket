With the roasted cauliflower, the flavor and texture of the finished dish was very \"saucy.\"  With the fried, it was a more satisfying main course and the cauliflower flavor came through.  Both are delicious, but my favorite was the fried. Panko is key!",

      "description": "Think of cauliflower Parmesan as the winter analogue to eggplant Parmesan. This fried cauliflower is worth making all on its own, with golden, crisp florets that are impossible to stop eating. But they’re even better when given the parm treatment — baked with marinara sauce, mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese until bubbling and browned. If you’re not a cauliflower fan, this recipe also works with broccoli.",
