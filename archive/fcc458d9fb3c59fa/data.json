The only problem I had was the wrapper coz I bought a premade one and most didn&#039;t stick together because the edges went too dry and brittle, and they also tear easily. So if you want to try this recipe, it&#039;s best you make your own wrapper. I managed to make some hold their shape. Still, I really enjoyed it. Thank you for this recipe!",

          "text": "We are vegetarians so we decided to try using the new pea protein meat replacement (some stuff Beyond Burgers are made of). It turned out great! I also minced 1/4 sweet potato just to make it a little more healthy. For my wraps, I used 1/4 cup of the flour as whole wheat also to make it a little more healthy. The texture was unaffected. I added a tbsp of water and let the dough sit for a full half hour in the bag before kneading and rolling them out. I agree with Maangchi that the steamed dumplings are better than fried. I think this is because the wraps are freshly made....so the texture is just amazing. I will never bother to fry these again, steaming is easier, tastier, and healthier. So so delicious. Thank you Maangchi! My family was very happy with our dinner tonight!!!",

Can we prepare the skin and put on top of one another and freeze it in a fridge instead of flat tray 2. How do we freeze the uncooked dumpling overnight for ( let say ) tomorrow family party. To be clearer on my question, do we immediately put all the uncooked dumpling into a single plastic bag or how 3. What is the expire date for the freeze dumpling 4. Can we immediately steam or fry the dumpling from the freezer or do they need to be taken out to get it soften before cooking. Hope to hear from you soon, Thanks so much",

          "text": "Hi Edward. 1. I just made a smaller version of the Kimchi Mandu using store-bought mandu (gyoza) skin.. if you are planning to make the skin yourself, based on my experience before, you can layer the skin on top of each other, but make sure you sprinkle some flour in between the layers so that they don&rsquo;t stick to each other. 2. If you are going to use it for tomorrow party and if you are making fresh mandu, you would need to put the dumplings in a single layer , but you don&rsquo;t have to freeze it. Just put it neatly on the non freezer fridge. 3. I think Maangchi mentioned that the frozen mandu can be kept up to 3 months. But i believe you would have finished them before that hahahhaa ^^ 4. If you want to boil them, you don&rsquo;t have to thaw them first. But just make sure that your water has boiled properly. However, if you want fried dumpling, i think it is better if you thaw them for a while, otherwise the skin would crack and the fillings will leak out. There is another method that i like to use. I would pan fry the mandu with little oil, then after the bottom part of mandu has browned, i would pour some water (be careful as the water may splash) and cover the pan. The mandu would be cooked by the steam from the water. Hope it helps, and happy cooking!",

          "text": "Hi Maangchi, Thanks so much for sharing your cooking techniques online. I never prepared Korean food before learning from your Youtube videos, but for several months now, I prepare many of your recipes, mostly for breakfast. My favorite has to be pajeong, but I love making mandu also and doenjang jigae...well, on and on. Just tried the wangmandu this morning and we have several chilling in the freezer to enjoy later in the week. Quick story: About 18 years ago my 15 year old son and I were stopped over on a plane flight in Seoul for about 8 hours. We&#039;d never been to Korea before and it was barely dawn, so we, and two friends, walked from the budget hotel where we were staying out into a small, partly residential , partly commercial, neighborhood, looking for a place to find an early breakfast. Everything was closed up and steel shutters pulled down in front of the businesses. There was a shop that had dried fish displayed in a window and as we stood there, a friendly man came up and asked us what we wanted. When we explained, he knocked on the door and an old woman opened the shop for us and prepared the fish in some broth cooked on a gas burner, and served us that with gim and rice and kimchi. It was my first ever Korean food. We left Korea that afternoon, continuing our flight. Over the years I used to think back on that experience and realize that although I&#039;d spent some time cooking western food professionally, and lived in cities like San Francisco and eaten in some very nice places, that breakfast in Seoul was the best breakfast I had ever eaten. Finally, a few months ago, I decided to research Korean food and found you on Youtube. Your recipes have brought a lot of pleasure to me and my family. Below is this morning&#039;s breakfast, if I can make the image work, on a very messy cutting board. Wangmandu, soft rice, gim, pickled garlic and steamed egg. All the best, Red",

          "text": "I made this recipe for dinner last night using pork belly instead of beef. I opted to use a food processor. The filling is worthy of a culinary award. It really is that good. The flavor, texture, aroma, appearance, all of it is 100% spot-on! You can eat this filling in gyoza, in dumplings, in tacos, in piroshky &hellip; or eat it out of a bowl with a little soy sauce sprinkled on it. I saved 1/2 of the filling to try baking inside calzone. I tried to make the skins but it did not go well for me. The first skin I rolled out was not so much round as it was shaped like Texas. By the time I got through 16 of them I pretty much had t down -- the last two skins were 5-1/2 inch across and round!",

          "text": "I made these this weekend and I learned a lot. First, this an incredibly delicious recipe. The filling is tender and soft and the handmade wrapper is wonderful, not at all like the little meatball inside a flabby, tasteless wrapper like the frozen ones from the store. Second,I learned that I need a LOT more practice before they start looking pretty and nicely pleated. It looks so easy in the video! Third, I learned that they dry out quickly if you don&#039;t cook them right away after forming them. I made them in the morning, covered them loosely with plastic and kept in the fridge until dinner time. Some got dried-out and were tough after cooking. Very interesting! I found out from some Korean moms cover them with a damp towel until ready to cook. I had so much fun making them, I will try it again as soon as I can. Thanks Maangchi!",

I&#039;m vegetarian, and I replaced the beef with soy crumbles seasoned like in the beef recipe above. It worked great! I did have a question--I froze maybe 50 dumplings, because I bought small mandu-pi at my local Asian market. To cook them, should I thaw them first? I made ones to be steamed and once to be fried, like in your other mandu recipe. Is the method for cooking both kinds any different? Thank you!",
