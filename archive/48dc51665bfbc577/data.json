We added a big garlic clove, minced, as the butter was browning, before the corn. We didnt have corn (we’re in a remote place in the middle of winter) so we used frozen kernels and it was all super. In our opinion, totally worth it! We had it with salmon roasted on the pan (4 min skin side down and 4 min skin side up) and it was perfect. Highly recommend",

This summer: Grow yourself a pot of basil, find a local corn farmer, and make this pasta as many times as you can. \n\nTake Melissa's advice to taste/consider when adding lemon and adjusting salt, the balance here is a significant factor in achieving optimal flavor. I recommend adding more corn and boiling the cobs to make a corn broth for the pasta as other comments suggest. \n\nThis dish amplifies the joys of summer. THANK YOU MELISSA!",
