In the south there's a delightful version using curry leaves and chili peppers along with cilantro and tomatoes. Try adding curry powder, its aromatic and amazing, the complex flavors tingle in the mouth and you are fully awake!",

Finally the beaten eggs were stirred in until it all came together in a creamy dish of scrambled eggs.  I will definitely make your Asian version.",
