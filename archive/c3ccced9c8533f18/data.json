      "description": "This easy chicken sheet-pan supper brings bold, warming flavors with minimal fuss. Tossed with ras el hanout, the chicken roasts alongside potatoes, sweet peppers and chickpeas, creating a richly flavored dish that practically makes its own sauce. The sheet pan may look crowded, but everything melts beautifully together as it cooks. The peppers, potatoes and chickpeas simmer gently in the oil, while the chicken sits halfway in, its skin staying crispy as the juices mingle below. Any chickpeas peeking out get delightfully crisp, while the rest confit in the oil, becoming soft and smooth. A finishing drizzle of sherry vinegar adds a bright, tangy kick, balancing the warm spices and bringing out the dish’s deep roasted flavours. Best of all, the prep is simple, and the oven does the rest, making this perfect for a cozy midweek dinner that still feels special.",

I used chicken breasts cut into chunks for my recipe and it turned out well.  I did find that the potatoes take quite a bit longer to cook through than the other veggies, so, I may parboil next time before adding.  Also, there was a lot of discussion about the amount of olive oil, so, I erred on the side of caution and used the 1/4 cup amount suggested in notes.  Next time, I will use the full amount in the recipe, as it will assist the veggies to cook better and make that delightful sauce. \nThank you to the contributor who wrote out the spices needed for the ras el hanout mixture🙏🏻.",

Absolutely reduced the oil by more than half, and next time I'll use less again. \nUsed verjuice, lemon juice and lemon zest in place of the vinegar; used a commercial Moroccan spice mix in place of the recommended blend because i live in Brisbane and our supermarkets are kinda vanilla, added carrots and pumpkin. Next time I'll roast the potatoes, carrots and pumpkin for 15-20 minutes before adding.\nUsed culantro as no coriander",

      "description": "This easy chicken sheet-pan supper brings bold, warming flavors with minimal fuss. Tossed with ras el hanout, the chicken roasts alongside potatoes, sweet peppers and chickpeas, creating a richly flavored dish that practically makes its own sauce. The sheet pan may look crowded, but everything melts beautifully together as it cooks. The peppers, potatoes and chickpeas simmer gently in the oil, while the chicken sits halfway in, its skin staying crispy as the juices mingle below. Any chickpeas peeking out get delightfully crisp, while the rest confit in the oil, becoming soft and smooth. A finishing drizzle of sherry vinegar adds a bright, tangy kick, balancing the warm spices and bringing out the dish’s deep roasted flavours. Best of all, the prep is simple, and the oven does the rest, making this perfect for a cozy midweek dinner that still feels special.",
