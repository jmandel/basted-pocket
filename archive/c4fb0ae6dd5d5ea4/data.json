      "description": "Green Goddess dressing — a creamy, piquant blend of herbs, garlic and anchovies — is good to eat on salad. And it’s wonderful as a dipping sauce for vegetables. But its best use may be as a marinade for roast chicken. The mild chicken absorbs all the zippy flavors of the dressing, to emerge from the oven fragrant and golden, flecked with green. To intensify the herbal flavor, some of the green goddess mixture is set aside to use as a sauce. You could even pour a little on a salad or some vegetables on the side, and enjoy the best of all the Green Goddess variations in one savory bite.",

I cut through the breast bone which ends up leaving 1/2 without any breast bone and the other half with the intact breast bone before cooking.

Although I was  few steps behind them, the red hair was just so distinctive. A few years earlier, I had seen Madonna exiting the Ritz in Paris, but seeing Melissa Clark in the Louvre was so much more exciting for this 71-year-old NYT Cooking fan girl. Much to the embarrassment of the teenager traveling with me, and I suspect the teenager traveling with Melissa, I called out “Are you Melissa Clark?”  When she answered affirmatively with a smile, I called out “Green Goddess Chicken!” That said it all. A most perfect recipe from the goddess of NYT Cooking. BTW, I have also adjusted the oven temp to 450 degrees. If you haven’t tried this recipe, what are you waiting for? Melissa, I will be in Paris in October. Hope to see you again. Musee d’Orsay perhaps?",

But its best use may be as a marinade for roast chicken. The mild chicken absorbs all the zippy flavors of the dressing, to emerge from the oven fragrant and golden, flecked with green. To intensify the herbal flavor, some of the green goddess mixture is set aside to use as a sauce. You could even pour a little on a salad or some vegetables on the side, and enjoy the best of all the Green Goddess variations in one savory bite.",
