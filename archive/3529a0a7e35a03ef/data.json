  "main_text_content": "Red lentil kofte is very much enjoyed by Turks at tea parties next to pastries, cakes or as a side dish next to main courses during lunch or dinner.  It is incredibly delicious because of all the spices and aromatics in it as well as it is filling. This crowd-pleaser can be prepared in advance and served cold. We wrap our koftes in lettuce leaves and drizzle some lemon juice or pomegranate sauce before devouring it.",
