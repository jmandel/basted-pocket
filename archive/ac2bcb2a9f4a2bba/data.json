      "description": "Bundt cakes are classic showstoppers — big, lofty and usually dressed in elegant drizzles and drips of glaze. Here, a dense, moist cake full of warm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty brown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to serve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think it's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered  and resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you can find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made from raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking agent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than conventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.",

Fifteen minutes later my apartment was suddenly filling up with smoke.  I turned off the oven and ran to get my doorman.  He discovered a flaming potholder in with the yams, pulled it out with his bare hands and threw it in the sink.  Meanwhile the cake was still on the cooling rack minding its own business despite the very dense smoke.  I opened every window and went to do laundry because the air was unbreathable.  Two hours later I returned, calmed myself down, and cautiously toasted the pepitas and made the glaze.  After glazing the cake I had to taste test before bringing it in to work to make sure it didn’t taste like ashes.  Delicious! and in a nutshell, indestructible. My doorman will be handsomely rewarded for saving the day.",

      "description": "Bundt cakes are classic showstoppers — big, lofty and usually dressed in elegant drizzles and drips of glaze. Here, a dense, moist cake full of warm fall spices and pumpkin purée is encased in a layer of rich, nutty brown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to serve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think it's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered  and resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you can find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made from raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking agent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than conventional confectioners’ sugar — a tip picked up from Stella Parks.",
