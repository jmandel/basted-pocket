Also, adding cheese during egg cooking time will help get the melted action going on before eggs overcook. :) I thought overall this was a fantastic dish, I added zucchini for some additional vegetable action. The flavors all worked well together and the lime added the pop to the entire dish.",

I sauteed onions mix till almost caramalized before adding chard. As others said, watch eggs carefully!  lime juice and cilantro are a must. I will definitely make again!",

We halve the recipe, but keep the greens the same and add a teaspoon or two of chipotle en adobo during the green-wilting step. Instead of tortillas, we also toasted a slice of sourdough and spread the compound butter from Melissa Clark's Green Garlic Toast recipe. The chipotle en adobo *really* adds depth to the dish and the garlic toast turns it into easy decadence.",

Otherwise it has a deep earthy flavor of chard and cream, lacking an acid, which is not what I expected of shakshuka. Feels a bit heavy with the cream. Would forego the avocado next time, as there is already plenty of fat going on in this dish. Made full veg and only 4 eggs to serve 2 people who eat a lot of veg. Had 1 egg left over. Served with corn tortillas toasted on cast iron griddle.",

It’s like celery without any of the stringiness, but more tender, with a mild and surprisingly savory spinachy flavor.",

      "description": "This easy twist on classic North African shakshuka (traditionally eggs baked in tomato-pepper sauce, with cumin, paprika and cayenne) starts with an onion-garlic-chard sautéed until gently wilted: a nest of sorts for steam-poaching eggs. Once the eggs go in, be sure to keep the flame low and keep the pan covered while cooking, so the eggs stay soft and almost oozy at their yolk, and the Cotija melts a bit. The chard and the half-and-half create a sort of light broth at the bottom of the shakshuka, which holds so much flavor and is one of the dish’s charms. Lastly, be daring with smoked hot sauce at the end: It’ll push the creamy avocado, cheese and eggs to their peak.",
