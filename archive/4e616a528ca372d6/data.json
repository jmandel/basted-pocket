This is easy and delicious.  My spouse suggested marinating the chicken in the gouchujang glaze- I’d be willing to put the time in to do that.   The root veg played so well with the gouchujang- the sweetness and spice is well balanced.  It might be my new favorite sheet pan.  I would happily sub in tofu for the chicken.  \n\nMy one tweak would be to use a mandolin for paper thin radish slices.  I used a watermelon radish (thank you, farm box), which is good but I think the thinner slices would really make the simple salad shine.  \n\nThis one will be a regular winter dinner.  (Especially now that I’ve found a year round CSA and I suspect I’m in for a lot of root veg, squash, and potatoes!)",

Boneless chicken thighs work better, along with adding dollops of mayonnaise to the chicken sauce (and mixing), so it clings better. Best sheet pan recipe ever.",
