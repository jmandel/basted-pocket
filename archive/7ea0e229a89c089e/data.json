      "description": "A velvety fish pie, filled with chunks of seafood in a delicate sauce, is classic cold-weather comfort food in the British Isles. This seafood pie is fancier than most. It’s got a buttery puff pastry topping that turns golden and crunchy as it bakes. And it’s brimming with seven varieties of fish, including scallops and shrimp, to make it festive enough to serve for a blowout Christmas Eve meal, like the Italian-American celebration Feast of the Seven Fishes. That said, if you’d rather keep things simpler, using just two or three kinds of fish still results in a stunning pie. Alaskan wild pollock, a mild, flaky fish that’s becoming more and more available in seafood markets, is a lovely and sustainable choice, as is Pacific cod.",

Before serving I placed the pastry on top of the casserole.   This way, the individual elements came out perfectly and once reassembled, was a dish to be proud of.",

      "description": "A velvety fish pie, filled with chunks of seafood in a delicate sauce, is classic cold-weather comfort food in the British Isles. This seafood pie is fancier than most. It’s got a buttery puff pastry topping that turns golden and crunchy as it bakes. And it’s brimming with seven varieties of fish, including scallops and shrimp, to make it festive enough to serve for a blowout Christmas Eve meal, like the Italian-American celebration Feast of the Seven Fishes. That said, if you’d rather keep things simpler, using just two or three kinds of fish still results in a stunning pie. Alaskan wild pollock, a mild, flaky fish that’s becoming more and more available in seafood markets, is a lovely and sustainable choice, as is Pacific cod.",
