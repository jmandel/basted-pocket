These are so much better than store bought and well worth the wait for them. They grew kinda wild looking going all over the place but tasted 진짜 맛있어요!!! 감사합니다 for an awesome recipe! J",

          "text": "Hi Maangchi, First of all, thanks so much for this site - you can really tell it&#039;s a labor of love! I had a basic knowledge of Korean cooking but you&#039;ve inspired me to try even more dishes. :) I had three questions... first, do you know if the soybeans for sprouting are non-GMO? Second, do you know where I can find a planter like yours? Or would a small plastic colander work? (Although I guess since they need to be encouraged to grow straight down, maybe not?) Third, does the holding container need to be glass, or does it not matter? Thanks in advance for your help - I&#039;m super excited to try this!!",

Now I live in a small town where I have to drive 3 hours to get to a Korean market, so I can only buy 1 bag of kongnamul since it won&#039;t keep for long in the fridge. Now I can grow my own &amp; my daughters will love this project. Thanks Maangchi!",

Actually I have a bucket with holes to grow a large quantity of kongnamul, too! : ) But for the video, I used just 1 cup of dried kongnamulkong (dried soybeans for sprouting). Good luck with you and your daughters&#039; kongnamul project!",

Now - what I want to know if there can be used some other types of beans... if the &quot;soybean for sprouting&quot; connot be found!!! There are parts of the world where it can be more than difficult to find out soybean for sprouting or it&#039;s not something usual to find in markets... but if I&#039;m looking at your shared ideea...maybe you can give us an answer... so It can be replaced with some other types of beans?! Anyway - excellent post!",

          "text": "What an incredibly timely post!! I&#039;ve been trying to sprout my own soybeans ever since I discovered that my local market only carries sprouts grown from GMO seeds. (Yes, I know they&#039;re supposed to be safe but I&#039;d feel better waiting for the results of more independent and long term testing.) Thank you so much for your very clear directions. The first couple of times I tried, I used the wrong variety of soybeans not realizing that some are better than others for sprouting. I then purchased soybeans for sprouting from Sprout People, where I purchase my other sprouting seeds, but I could only get 1/4&quot; tail. Their directions are very different from yours. They recommend only soaking for 2-12 hours initially and only rinsing 2-3 times a day there after but then they like their soybean sprouts with a short tail. I can&#039;t wait to give your directions a try. I&#039;ve really missed eating your kongnamulguk (spicy vegetarian recipe) and have been wanting to add soybean sprouts to my stir-fries. Does your bag happen to specify which variety of soybean it is other just &quot;soybean for sprouting&quot;? I&#039;ve read that the best sprouting varieties are Chief, Ebony, Illini, Lincoln, Richland, Peking, Cayuga and Otoot. If your bag specifies the variety, I thought I&#039;d write to Sprout People to see if they use the same one though hopefully, I&#039;ll have good luck with any of the sprouting varieties if I follow your directions. Thanks again for the great directions. I&#039;ll let you know how mine come out. I&#039;m going to go look for a good bowl to use today. Do you think a colander or Easy Sprout work or are larger holes needed in the bottom like yours?",
