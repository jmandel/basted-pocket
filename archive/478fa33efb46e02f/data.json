Seemed like a lot of oil. This salad is very flavorful! For those who said it was bland, if you're tasting the dressing as you add the lemon, salt and pepper it will be  seasoned to one's own taste.

I found I needed to add black pepper at the end for balance. Good flavor overall. I think something briny, like chopped olives or capers could be a nice addition in the future.",

Just be sure to let it come to room temperature so everything is at its brightest and most supple.",
