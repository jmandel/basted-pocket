I find no significant difference. In fact, I prefer the ground lime because my spice grinder tends to leave some larger pieces of the whole black limes. Also, I always have made this with four individually cut pieces of salmon instead of one large. The cooking time obviously is less. I prefer that each person has a stand alone piece of art on the plate. The presentation is very dramatic with the vibrant colors of the salmon, the sour cream, the black lime spice mix and the grated tomatoes. Wonderful!",

      "description": "This deceptively simple salmon dish is as striking in flavor as in appearance, and will serve just as well for a dinner party centerpiece as a quick midweek dinner. The salmon is covered in a punchy black lime marinade, then baked in the oven and topped with fresh bursts of sour cream and grated tomato. Black limes (also known as Omani or Persian limes) are limes that have been boiled in salt water before being dried and blackened in the sun. They have an intensely sweet, citrusy flavor, with a hint of bitterness. Serve this salmon alongside a bowl of rice.",
