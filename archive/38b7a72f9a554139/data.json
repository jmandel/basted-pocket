This take does the same, but instead of simmering a huge pot for hours, it uses proportionally less water and cooks in under an hour for a satisfying meal. This method ensures that the broth is deeply flavorful, the meat still juicy and the vegetables and barley tender with an ideal bite. You can swap in other root vegetables for the carrots and other varieties of cabbage for the napa, but aim for options that end up naturally sweet when cooked. The resulting soup is warming with ginger and ideal for recovering from a cold, but if you prefer a punchier flavor, dress it up with bold condiments.",

I used bone-in skin-on chicken thighs and was glad because it provided more meat for the dish.\nNext time I’ll increase the ginger and possibly use 4 cups of water and 4 cups of chicken bone broth.\nOverall a delicious chicken soup and a fun variation of a cold-cure soup in this behemoth winter.",

The skin on a drumstick is thin and added just the right amount of fat; the bones are dense which made for a welcome creamy gelatinous texture. Thanks for sharing",

      "description": "Homestyle Chinese soups, particularly Cantonese ones, distill the essence of bony meat and vegetables into subtle broths. This take does the same, but instead of simmering a huge pot for hours, it uses proportionally less water and cooks in under an hour for a satisfying meal. This method ensures that the broth is deeply flavorful, the meat still juicy and the vegetables and barley tender with an ideal bite. You can swap in other root vegetables for the carrots and other varieties of cabbage for the napa, but aim for options that end up naturally sweet when cooked. The resulting soup is warming with ginger and ideal for recovering from a cold, but if you prefer a punchier flavor, dress it up with bold condiments.",
