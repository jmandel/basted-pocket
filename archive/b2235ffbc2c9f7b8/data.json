Definitely recommend making a little extra salad of about half a pint of additional cherry tomatoes, a handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley, and about a tsp of olive oil. After arranging the cooked chickpeas and tomatoes on the cold cucumber/yogurt mixture, top it off with the “salad.” Extra EXTRA bonus flavor blast? Sprinkle a handful of pomegranate seeds and squeeze a lemon wedge on the final dish. Truly gorgeous colors and nuanced flavor profile.",

Since chickpeas are kinda squashable, it wouldn’t do well to towel them off, and it probably would be overkill to lay them out on a towel to dry. Just get the rinsing water mostly gone.",

      "description": "Much like the combination of chana masala and raita, this dish’s appeal lies in the contrasts: soft and warm chickpeas and tomatoes rest atop a layer of cool and crunchy cucumber yogurt. The cooking happens quickly; sauté small tomatoes and chickpeas just until softened and fragrant with spices, then pile the mixture onto a swirl of yogurt that’s zesty with chopped cucumbers, garlic, lemon and herbs. The yogurt will loosen under the topping’s warmth and weight, so serve with rice, focaccia or flatbread such as roti or doubles to sop up the lushness.",
