      "description": "Carrot cake has always felt like a fall-winter dessert due to its warming spices, dried fruits, and nuts. This version, inspired by Italian citrus cakes made with olive oil, feels lighter and brighter and is incredibly quick to put together because there is no grating required. The carrots are tossed in a blender along with the wet ingredients, creating a smooth texture and a much lighter cake without those bits of carrot, fruit and nuts weighing it down. (Another light, fluffy carrot cake made with a blended batter, called bolo de cenoura, is also popular in Brazil.) Orange zest and juice brighten things up, and cardamom brings in that warmth you want in a carrot cake while keeping it distinct from the classic.&nbsp;",

Put the parchment circle on the oily pan bottom and run the thin strip of paper around the inside of the pan’s oily edge. The oil should make the parchment stick.

      "description": "Carrot cake has always felt like a fall-winter dessert due to its warming spices, dried fruits, and nuts. This version, inspired by Italian citrus cakes made with olive oil, feels lighter and brighter and is incredibly quick to put together because there is no grating required. The carrots are tossed in a blender along with the wet ingredients, creating a smooth texture and a much lighter cake without those bits of carrot, fruit and nuts weighing it down. (Another light, fluffy carrot cake made with a blended batter, called bolo de cenoura, is also popular in Brazil.) Orange zest and juice brighten things up, and cardamom brings in that warmth you want in a carrot cake while keeping it distinct from the classic.&nbsp;",
