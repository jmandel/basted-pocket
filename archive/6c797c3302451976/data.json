There is a little learning curve, but once you figure it out and get the stove temp right, you can make them quickly. I also did not have sweet rice, so I substituted Italian Arborio rice (used for risotto). Came out perfectly, and after soaking all night ground to a paste with the mung beans with no problems. I will be making these regularly!",

I wish I had remembered to take pictures before I put the leftovers in the freezer. :) The only ingredient I omitted was the fernbrake because the smell was too strong for me while it was in the pressure cooker. My family is from Lebanon and also the Dominican Republic and we all love to test and taste your recipes! Thank you for making them so fun and easy to follow! I look forward to each of your new recipes! &hearts;",
