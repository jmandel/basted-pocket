The idea of keeping a simple, refreshing and not-too-sweet cake on hand for ordinary use (unexpected or planned drop-by visits, a needed post-challenge pick-me-up, or whatever) brings back the notion of simpler village life when we could all expect unannounced visitors to whom it would be polite to offer a hospitable bite and a cup of coffee or tea.

Use the full 2TBSP of sugar on the top which takes away the bitterness of the lemon slices and adds some needed sweetness.\n2.  At 60 min. bake time, the cake was still quite moist inside (and a toothpick did not come out clean).  I pulled it anyway and it was baked perfectly.  (My oven is calibrated)\n3.  You need more than two lemons to produce 2TBSP of zest",

I let the slices for top and bottom sit in a bowl with sugar for a while before putting them on.\n\nI've added grated fresh ginger.\n\nI've added a Tsp of cardamon which gives the cake a slight spicy savory flavor. Next time I do that, I'll reduce the sugar a bit. More turmeric is nice too",

It travels well, and can truly be brought anywhere for any occasion, but most of the time it won’t make it out of your kitchen.",
