          "text": "Hey Kaseixjaa! For the patties not holding shape, I would first make sure you use firm tofu since it&#039;ll be easier to squeeze out all the excess water because any moisture in the tofu will make it harder for the patties to bind and hold shape. If you still find it hard for them to hold shape you can add a pinch of flour to help it bind. As for the veggies if you don&#039;t want them as crunchy I would suggest giving them a quick saute in a pan, but make sure you drain any excess oil or moisture that had cooked out and to also let them cool completely before adding it into the mixture. Hope that helps! Happy cooking! -Teddy",
