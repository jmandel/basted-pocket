I made the short cut version with salad greens (red leaf and baby spinach), and did not bake the chickpeas with so much oil.

So good, we will certainly make this again.",

The vegetarian cookbook writer Hetty McKinnon created this recipe, and the amount of olive oil she calls for might seem excessive. Don’t hold back: After cooking the chickpeas, the oil becomes part of the garlicky, paprika-warmed dressing for the finished dish. You could make her recipe even easier by using salad greens instead of cooked greens as the base.",
