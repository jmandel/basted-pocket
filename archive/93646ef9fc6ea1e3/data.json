      "description": "Inspired by the jaunty pasta dish, spaghetti al limone, here’s a new way to make a memorable meal from humble cans of chickpeas; just add lemon, olive oil and Parmesan. The chickpeas are braised in their own sweet and nutty brine, also known as aquafaba, which becomes thick and silky as it cooks down. Much like starchy pasta cooking water, the aquafaba helps the lemon juice and oil emulsify into a silky sauce. Burrata adds another touch of richness and creaminess to this already elegant dish, but you could easily swap a jammy egg in its stead. Eat these beans with bread, to mop up the lemony sauce.",

      "description": "Inspired by the jaunty pasta dish, spaghetti al limone, here’s a new way to make a memorable meal from humble cans of chickpeas; just add lemon, olive oil and Parmesan. The chickpeas are braised in their own sweet and nutty brine, also known as aquafaba, which becomes thick and silky as it cooks down. Much like starchy pasta cooking water, the aquafaba helps the lemon juice and oil emulsify into a silky sauce. Burrata adds another touch of richness and creaminess to this already elegant dish, but you could easily swap a jammy egg in its stead. Eat these beans with bread, to mop up the lemony sauce.",
