Broccoli rabe is very bitter and I usually eat it after blanching and carefully sautéing for a very long time, which mellows and sweetens it.  The combination of broccoli rabe with green pepper was really astringent.  The eggs and potato gets lost.  If I did it again I’d use a different green, sub out the green bell pepper for zucchini, and serve it over a creamy potato puree or polenta.",

While we don't want crispy crunchy veggies here, it'd be better to cook, remove, and then re-add the peppers and onions alongside the broccoli rabe after the potatoes have time to cook and simmer. I also blanched the broc and it was perfect. Add lemon zest at the end!",

Traditionally, it’s a tomato-based mixture, reflecting the Mediterranean market. But there are no rules. Here’s an earthy green version made with broccoli rabe, potatoes and peppers. Tomato sauce alongside would not be a mistake, nor would slices of garlic sausage tucked throughout.",
