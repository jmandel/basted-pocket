      "description": "This zippy sheet pan dinner takes inspiration from leeks vinaigrette, a French bistro dish in which leeks are boiled until tender and dressed with a mustard vinaigrette. Here, the leeks are roasted, along with some capers, for plenty of satisfying crunch and caramelized flavor. When the leeks are tender, the fish fillets are added right to the pan and roasted until tender and flaky. (A flaky white fish, like cod or halibut, or even salmon would work well here.) Finally, what brings this dish together is the quick, punchy vinaigrette made with whole-grain mustard, parsley, shallots and red wine vinegar. Spooned over everything before serving, it balances the richness of the roasted leeks and fish with just the right amount of acidity and freshness.",

I halved the recipe, except for the sauce, and if I were making the full recipe, I think I’d double the sauce. I do have a curiosity about the leeks: I feel like the two leeks you get in the bag at Trader Joe’s are medium-sized, and yet they only produced a scant 3 cups when thinly sliced. That was fine by me, as I only had a pound of cod, but it would be disappointing if I had double the fish. Oh well. I served with braised greens and new potatoes and a crisp Sauvignon Blanc and everything was delightful!",

      "description": "This zippy sheet pan dinner takes inspiration from leeks vinaigrette, a French bistro dish in which leeks are boiled until tender and dressed with a mustard vinaigrette. Here, the leeks are roasted, along with some capers, for plenty of satisfying crunch and caramelized flavor. When the leeks are tender, the fish fillets are added right to the pan and roasted until tender and flaky. (A flaky white fish, like cod or halibut, or even salmon would work well here.) Finally, what brings this dish together is the quick, punchy vinaigrette made with whole-grain mustard, parsley, shallots and red wine vinegar. Spooned over everything before serving, it balances the richness of the roasted leeks and fish with just the right amount of acidity and freshness.",
