      "description": "At Spicy Village in in Manhattan’s Chinatown, the Spicy Big Tray Chicken arrives on an aluminum tray. You eat it on a foam plate with a plastic fork or chopsticks. It’s a mound of chicken nearly afloat in a bath of dark, spicy sauce that contains star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, chile, garlic, cilantro, a few mystery ingredients and potatoes.  Those of you who live in or visit New York should eat this dish whenever you can, but it can absolutely be prepared at home. It’s not precisely a simple recipe. But it’s an excellent project one. And you can improve on the ingredients. The restaurant uses both MSG and Budweiser in the recipe. We subbed in Modelo Negra and omitted the MSG, but you certainly don't need to.",

I filtered the cooled fat through a paper towel in a sieve set into a funnel back into the jar I used once before. It is getting more and more chicken fat tasting! It will go over my woodpile when it starts to turn rancid. But protected from air and light, I will probably get a few more chicken fries out of it. I don't fear deep fat frying.",

I used the rendered fat to begin at step 4 with a wok and it turned out well. I also added some sautéed green beans.",

I added 1/2, not 2, tbsp of sugar (brown), and Korean Gochujang instead of Sichuan hot bean sauce. I had a large fresh red chili so I used that, not dried. mmmm",

It is known as \"da pan ji\" or \"big plate chicken.\" It is usually served over long wide noodles (think tagliatelle but like 2 or 3 times as wide). Not sure why the noodles are left out here as that's one of the best parts of this dish! You can usually find these noodles or something similar in the refrigerated section in a Chinese market. \n\nHappy cooking!",

Cooling food on the counter before refrigerating is a great way to ensure the food stays in the danger zone between 40F and 140F. Place cooked food in a shallow pan, not piled up or too close together, and refrigerate. If you want to avoid sogginess from condensation cool it unwrapped to start, then wrap once it has cooled if you plan to store it more than a few hours.",

      "description": "At Spicy Village in in Manhattan’s Chinatown, the Spicy Big Tray Chicken arrives on an aluminum tray. You eat it on a foam plate with a plastic fork or chopsticks. It’s a mound of chicken nearly afloat in a bath of dark, spicy sauce that contains star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, chile, garlic, cilantro, a few mystery ingredients and potatoes.  Those of you who live in or visit New York should eat this dish whenever you can, but it can absolutely be prepared at home. It’s not precisely a simple recipe. But it’s an excellent project one. And you can improve on the ingredients. The restaurant uses both MSG and Budweiser in the recipe. We subbed in Modelo Negra and omitted the MSG, but you certainly don't need to.",
