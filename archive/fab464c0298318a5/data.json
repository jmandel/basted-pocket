Bringing the buttermilk to 100 degrees without curdling it was time consuming.  The dough was so soft it made tight rolling difficult so I had gaps between the layers.  I even had the insight to roll using parchment, alas.  Yet this soft dough yields a cakey textured roll that seemed baffling to me.

Because we lost power for over 12 hrs, I had to throw out the frosting, so they are bare. But, they are so sweet and rich without it. Next time I have a full day to make these suckers, I will reserve 1-2T of the filling to sprinkle on top instead.",
