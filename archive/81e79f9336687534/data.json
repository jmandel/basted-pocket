Used water instead of stock, onion instead of leek, and lemon instead of lime, as the author recommended on Instagram—all serviceable substitutions. And when I went to add the cinnamon, I accidentally dropped the container into the pot, so that was accidentally quadrupled (octupled?)! But I just loved the result, so, if I make this again, that mistake will be repeated.",

      "description": "This one-pan meal, which is inspired by the tagines of North Africa, is prepared in a deep skillet or Dutch oven instead of the traditional clay pot. Briefly marinate bone-in chicken thighs in lime juice, garlic, cumin and olive oil, then brown and set aside. (If you’re short on time, skip the marinade; simply add the ground cumin when you’re toasting the other spices in the chicken fat.) Stir in harissa, cinnamon and turmeric, toast until fragrant, then add quick-cooking pearl couscous and the chicken, so everything finishes cooking together. Top the finished dish with a fistful of roughly chopped tender herbs and lime zest for a jolt of brightness.",
