I also am often frustrated by having too much fat emerge from the fish.  This recipe worked very well to solve all those problems.  I think the steam from the rice must be a key, plus  it allows a relatively quick cooking time.  As for the rice itself, season to your preference is all I can say.",

When you cook the rice the first time, it says the water should be “almost” gone. That’s not very specific. My advice is to cook the rice separately on the stove. That way you can control the cook times for the salmon and the rice and not have to hope they come out at the same time. We ate the salmon and let the rice cook a bit longer. Not ideal to eat in stages.",

Add fresh or dried dill to basmati rice, which is eventually topped with salmon covered in a tangy, sweet and spicy paste of mayo, lemon zest, honey and dried chile flakes. To ensure the rice is perfectly fluffy without overcooking the fish, the grains are baked until most of the water is absorbed before the salmon is added over the top.",
