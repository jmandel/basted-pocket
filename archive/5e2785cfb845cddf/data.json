You could taste the coriander and a bit of the red pepper flakes, but the only saving grace was a squeeze of lemon when served.  Seemed like a waste of good oil although if I do this again, I would infuse the oil, then let sit out to blend and intensify the flavors before using.  Could be tasty on all sorts of dishes.",

I also added some ground cumin. I think I stayed within the spirit of the recipe.",

      "description": "Roasting salmon low and slow in a shallow pool of olive oil guarantees that it won't overcook — and that it'll soak up whatever other flavors are swimming in the oil. Dried chile, fennel and coriander provide a crunchy bite and sneaky heat to the buttery salmon. Serve it warm or at room temperature, with cucumbers, drizzles of more spicy oil, and feta, for a little more plushness. Store any leftover salmon for up to 2 days in the oil, so it doesn’t dry out.",
