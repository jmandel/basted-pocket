I used my cast iron dutch oven as the earthenware substitute, teeny tiny 1/2 inch dried anchovies found in the frozen section at the local Korean supermarket so no need to gut, salted mini shrimp from a jar instead of regular shrimp, one jalape&ntilde;o instead of the green chile pepper, Pulmone silken tofu instead of the tube tofu, dried shiitake for the stock and fresh local shiitakes for frying with the grass-fed ground beef, and added watercress near the end for extra green. My 4 year old daughter wanted to try the squid and kept coming back for more even though it was spicy! Next time, I&#039;ll make Pulmone&#039;s hand-made style noodles to go with it and we&#039;ll eat like kings! Thank you for your excellent recipe!",

I ended up adjusting the recipe for a serving of one instead, just for a change. Instead of two tablespoons, I did three teaspoons instead. One teaspoon of fish sauce, soup soy sauce, and oyster sauce to make it a little bit sweet. And I added a sprinkle of salt. This is the best I have ever had. Take care!",

I&#039;m sure they are the base for a great flavor, but like I said, they will be a hurdle for me! I have to tell you that I so appreciate how you link the ingredients to an info page.

          "text": "I&#039;m glad to hear that your first time to make soondubujjigae turned out great! : ) &quot;Are hot pepper flakes and pepper powder the same?&quot; Yes, they are made of the same kinds of Korean dried hot peppers and both are called gochugaru in Korean. Only difference is that hot pepper flakes are coarsely ground and the hot pepper powder is just as it indicates, powdered. I use hot pepper flakes in my most of cooking. Hot pepper powder is used for making Korean gochujang because the texture should be like paste when it ferments.
