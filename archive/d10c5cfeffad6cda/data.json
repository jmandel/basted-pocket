      "description": "This fresh soup is a riff on something that a Chinese or Korean mom might make, with rice cakes added to bulk it up. You can find the white, oval disks in most Asian supermarkets; they are made with glutinous rice flour and have a chewy texture. They are precooked, but will rehydrate and soak up more liquid in this soup. If you find that they have soaked up too much, simply add a little more broth or water to thin out the soup. Substituting one to two cups of cooked rice to the soup in place of the rice cakes works well if you don't have access to an Asian grocery store.",

Our kids devour it and ask for more. \n\nRight kind of rice cake is important. There are rice cakes and rice cakes but some aren’t tasty in texture and taste. I recommend “pulmuone”brand from Korea. I rinse my rice cakes under the hot water for a while. Or soak them in a hot tap water before adding them to the soup. They should be nicely soft in texture at the time you put them in the soup.\n\nI love adding little bit of sesame oil with the regular oil at the beginning when sautéing leeks and green onions and ginger (grated!). I usually use Swanson chicken broth but add more water to the soup. \n\nI am uncertain if the vinegar does anything to it for my taste but with eggs, I do use vinegar at the end. If I am not adding eggs, I sometimes leave the vinegar out. \n\nThe broth is not bland. If you would like more flavor, you could get good Korean soup soy sauce to add (a couple tablespoons of it would do).",

Our kids devour it and ask for more. \n\nRight kind of rice cake is important. There are rice cakes and rice cakes but some aren’t tasty in texture and taste. I recommend “pulmuone”brand from Korea. I rinse my rice cakes under the hot water for a while. Or soak them in a hot tap water before adding them to the soup. They should be nicely soft in texture at the time you put them in the soup.\n\nI love adding little bit of sesame oil with the regular oil at the beginning when sautéing leeks and green onions and ginger (grated!). I usually use Swanson chicken broth but add more water to the soup. \n\nI am uncertain if the vinegar does anything to it for my taste but with eggs, I do use vinegar at the end. If I am not adding eggs, I sometimes leave the vinegar out. \n\nThe broth is not bland. If you would like more flavor, you could get good Korean soup soy sauce to add (a couple tablespoons of it would do).",

      "description": "This fresh soup is a riff on something that a Chinese or Korean mom might make, with rice cakes added to bulk it up. You can find the white, oval disks in most Asian supermarkets; they are made with glutinous rice flour and have a chewy texture. They are precooked, but will rehydrate and soak up more liquid in this soup. If you find that they have soaked up too much, simply add a little more broth or water to thin out the soup. Substituting one to two cups of cooked rice to the soup in place of the rice cakes works well if you don't have access to an Asian grocery store.",
