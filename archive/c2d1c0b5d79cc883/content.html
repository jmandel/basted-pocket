She declared her first bite “a morsel of perfection.” Once you have had sole meunière, you will see why. This guide is part of The New Essentials of French Cooking, the 10 definitive dishes every modern cook should master.</p><div class="articleblocks_heading1blockContainer__b7XVE"><h1 class="pantry--title-display articleblocks_textLeft__DzA6Y" id="link-631a931e">Why Master It?</h1></div><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz"><strong>The French excel at exquisitely wrought and technically challenging fish dishes, </strong>like bouillabaisse and lobster Thermidor. However, they are just as enamored of simpler recipes that focus on preserving the pristine beauty of their seafood. Sole meunière is a perfect example.</p><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz">To prepare it, sole, a succulent, flat white fish, is pan-fried in butter until crisp-edged and tender, then served with brown butter pan sauce, a sprinkling of parsley and a wedge of lemon. (The term meunière means in the style of the miller’s wife, and refers to the flour in which the fish is dredged before frying.) Except for the browning of the butter, the ingredients are kept in their most elemental form. Yet together they create a dish of incomparable harmony and depth.</p><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz">In its most traditional presentation, sole meunière is made with the whole fish, then filleted tableside. You can still find it served that way at old-school French restaurants all over the world. But for the most part, home cooks use sole fillets, which makes the process faster and easier — and only slightly less flavorful and juicy than when the fish is cooked on the bone.</p><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz"><strong>Unlike a lot of classic French cuisine,</strong> sole meunière requires almost no advance preparation and very little time at the stove. It is one of the quickest ways to get to dinner, and you probably already have flour, salt, pepper, butter and lemon on hand. All you need is a beautiful piece of fish.</p><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz">That fish does not have be Dover sole, especially given that in recent years, its sustainability has become an issue (not to mention the fact that it is very expensive). Other flat, white, flaky fish will cook up nearly as well, and will taste delightful when pan-fried and smothered in brown butter. After all, there are very few things that wouldn’t.</p><div class="articleblocks_ruleBlock__FNpAT"><hr class="divider_divider__PSzI_ divider_thin__z_FOe"/></div><div class="articleblocks_heading2blockContainer__M_c6G"><h2 class="pantry--title-section articleblocks_textCenter__zN1xg" id="link-26be0d7d">Recipes: <a class="link_link__7WCQy link_default__lKxiG linkformat_link__lGafw" href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018509-sole-meuniere" title="">Sole Meunière</a> </h2></div><div class="articleblocks_mediaContainer__Np0GZ articleblocks_FULL__C21Ix"><div class="videoblock_videoBlock__hZfX_ videoblock_FULL__x27l0"><div class="videoblock_text__ZM_7Z"><span class="pantry--ui-sm videoblock_summary__khroN">A succulent fillet of white fish, pan-fried in clarified butter and served with a butter sauce.</span><span class="pantry--ui-xs">By<!-- --> </span><span class="pantry--ui-xs videoblock_credit__2Gt46">Meg Felling</span></div></div></div><div class="articleblocks_ruleBlock__FNpAT"><hr class="divider_divider__PSzI_ divider_thin__z_FOe"/></div><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz"></p><div class="articleblocks_heading1blockContainer__b7XVE"><h1 class="pantry--title-display articleblocks_textLeft__DzA6Y" id="link-74102126">A Brief History</h1></div><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz"><strong>With over 100 cataloged preparations</strong>, sole is one of the most esteemed fish in French cuisine, and sole meunière is the signature dish. It is the plainness of the recipe that makes it seem at once universal and utterly French. Almost all coastal cultures have some version of lightly fried fish, but only in France is it covered in brown butter.</p><div class="articleblocks_mediaContainer__Np0GZ articleblocks_LARGE__XWSoN"><figure class="imageblock_imageBlock__uz_xV imageblock_LARGE__fRh0e"><div class="imageblock_image__pBQ9O" style="aspect-ratio:1.784037558685446"><img alt="A scientific image of sole." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;color:transparent" sizes="100vw" srcSet="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 480w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 768w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1280w" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/21/multimedia/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk/21Sole-Meuniere-phgk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp"/></div><div class="imageblock_text__fRyh1"><span class="pantry--ui-sm imageblock_caption__o1dJ5">“Pleuronectes Solea, the Sole.”</span><span class="pantry--ui-xs">Courtesy of The New York Public Library</span></div></figure></div><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz">Little is known about how sole meunière came to be, though we do know that for at least the past century it’s been a specialty of Normandy. “Le Guide Culinaire,” by Auguste Escoffier, which was first published in 1903, lists several variations of the dish, including sole meunière with eggplant, with grapes, with cucumbers and with various kinds of mushrooms. However, it is likely that the dish is much older, since it is so very basic.</p><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz"><strong>Sole meunière has long been an extravagance,</strong> a costly fixture on the menus of many fine French restaurants.<strong> </strong>That is because it is traditionally made with Dover sole, a flat fish with delicate and buttery white meat, which separates easily from the bones.</p><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz">It is that combination of simplicity and luxury that makes it compelling. Elaborate adornments are not necessary, as was made clear in an edition of “Larousse Gastronomique” from the early 20th century: “Sometimes the serving of fish cooked à la meunière is decorated with slices, or half-slices, of lemon, rounds of radish, cutout pieces of beetroot and sprigs of parsley. This kind of ornament is quite useless and not at all in keeping with the recipe.”</p><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz">Today most French cooks would agree that you need nothing more on top of your buttery sole than a lemon wedge and a hint of parsley. <strong>That is the easiest lesson you can learn from French cooking: When you have perfect ingredients, less is more.</strong></p><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz"></p><div class="articleblocks_heading1blockContainer__b7XVE"><h1 class="pantry--title-display articleblocks_textLeft__DzA6Y" id="link-5442e514">Equipment You’ll Need</h1></div><ul class="articleblocks_listblock__UhMF2"><li class="pantry--body"><p class="pantry--body-long articleblocks_paragraphBlock__jYOwz">Use <strong>a 12-inch skillet,</strong> which should be large enough to fit the length of your fish.

You will end up with a more neutral and less buttery flavor, but the recipe will still work. (If you decide not to clarify, then it is especially important to use that high-fat, European-style butter.) Or you could use ghee, which is basically clarified butter in which the milk solids have been allowed to brown before being removed. It has a lightly caramelized, nutty flavor.</p></li></ul><div class="articleblocks_mediaContainer__Np0GZ articleblocks_LARGE__XWSoN"><figure class="imageblock_imageBlock__uz_xV imageblock_LARGE__fRh0e"><div class="imageblock_image__pBQ9O" style="aspect-ratio:1.5003663003663004"><img alt="A side image of sole being dredged in flour.
