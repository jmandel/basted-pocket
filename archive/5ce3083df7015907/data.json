Make sure you use really ripe, in-season figs, as they make all the difference here. The figs release their juices with the caramel, rum and orange to create a sauce that is perfect to scoop over the sponge cake when serving. For a more concentrated flavor, roast your figs separately before adding them to the caramel. A spoonful of crème fraîche is all you need here, but you could serve this with some vanilla ice cream, if you’re looking for a supertreat.",

I’ve made it with both fresh and dried figs and I think dried gives you better flavor and texture (not to mention they’re easier and cheaper to find year round). Just soak them in water for 20mins or so and remove the stems. \nThe caramel is annoying to make, but keep stirring it over low heat when it seizes and it’ll work out. As for hand whisking…not necessary unless you feel like it.",

Used a cast iron pan which was fine except for when we burnt the sugar. second time around used dark brown sugar and mixed it into the cooked rum rather than making a caramel. We roasted some figs at 425 for 15 minutes / until juicy. Also used black cocoa powder which made such a beautifully rich chocolate cake with less sweetness. Finally, sour cream is better than ice cream on this !!",

      "description": "This dessert is somewhere between a sponge cake and a clafoutis: light and airy, yet rich from the addition of dark chocolate and rum. Make sure you use really ripe, in-season figs, as they make all the difference here. The figs release their juices with the caramel, rum and orange to create a sauce that is perfect to scoop over the sponge cake when serving. For a more concentrated flavor, roast your figs separately before adding them to the caramel. A spoonful of crème fraîche is all you need here, but you could serve this with some vanilla ice cream, if you’re looking for a supertreat.",
