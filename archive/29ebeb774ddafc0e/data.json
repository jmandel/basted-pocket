          "text": "Just made this - it&#039;s steeping in the fridge. Can&#039;t wait to drink it! I noticed the ginger slices still had plenty of flavor after straining. I don&#039;t throw anything away that I&#039;ve already paid for if it still tastes good. So I removed the cinnamon, weighed the ginger and put it back in the pot. Then added an equal amount of sugar, a splash of water, and brought to boil. Then simmered for 20 minutes stirring frequently. When the liquid was almost gone and the ginger was getting translucent, I spread it out with chopsticks on a cooling rack set over a piece of foil. Now I have candied, cinnamon-spiced ginger as well as a yummy drink. I consider this a total bonus!",

Will it be too heaty because of the the ginger? We live in Singapore where our weather is rather humid, except for around this time of the year where it&#039;s rather cool.",

The punch is not quite the same, but it&#039;s a very tasty substitute. I&#039;ve made it once with the Japanese persimmons that are sometimes available fresh in certain areas, and it was good. I dried the persimmons in the oven at 200 degrees F. for a couple of hours beforehand to concentrate the flavors. When we go to Daegu, we always visit a samgyetang house that the family of one of our friends owns. They always serve sujeonggwa at the end of the meal, with a few pine nuts in the serving saucer. It is truly delicious.",

Apparently, some people find that drinking a shot of this tea twice a day relieves gastro-intestinal reflux disease (GERD) or acid reflux. Even better than Nexium, my favorite and most expensive prescription for my problem. I would really like to try this recipe immediately as I don&#039;t ever get true relief from all the medicines I&#039;ve tried so far. Where can I get the dried Persimmons on-line or locally? I live in Boynton Beach, FL 33472. Hope you can help! Thanks,Cindy",

          "text": "hey, cviravan! just another idea to use pine nuts for: toast them in a pan, add crushed garlic and oil, brown the garlic, then add dried cranberries and a little water or broth (to plump up the berries). once it evaporates, add a bitter green (like arugula, broccoli raab, or gai larn) and toss to mix until the greens are wilted and bright green. add black pepper and hot chili oil to taste. this is a great side dish, also great tossed with a chunky pasta and parmesan cheese. (although not korean, i hope maangchi doesn&#039;t mind, lol)",
