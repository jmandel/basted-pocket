      "description": "To replicate the fragrant and earthy flavors of merguez, a traditional North African sausage, this recipe calls for browning ground beef with plenty of fennel, cumin and coriander seeds, paprika and dried mint. Stirring in a jar of marinara results in a hearty, satisfying sauce much like classic Bolognese but with an added layer of warm, aromatic spices. If using store-bought merguez (which is often made with lamb and can be spicy depending on your tolerance), remember to remove the casing. Ribbon-like pasta shapes like linguine, spaghetti or tagliatelle work best with the sauce, but feel free to use what’s on hand.",
