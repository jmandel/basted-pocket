      "description": "This dark chocolate cake relies on stout beer to add malted notes. Coffee helps enhance the chocolate flavor, and sour cream keeps the cake moist for days. A spiked coffee glaze studded with cacao nibs lends crunch and a nice bitter edge. This recipe calls for natural-process cocoa powder, which, along with other acidic ingredients like dark brown sugar, coffee, beer and sour cream, reacts with baking soda to make the cake rise. Dutch-process cocoa is chemically neutral and should not be substituted here, as it may cause your cake to rise unevenly and could produce an unpleasant flavor. Available from speciality baking supply stores and online, black cocoa powder is also used in this recipe to enhance the dark cocoa color and flavor, but feel free to substitute more natural cocoa powder.",

Every black cocoa powder I could find was Dutch process (i.e. alkaline), yet recipe allows that to be substituted with natural cocoa powder (acidic).  Is the black cocoa powder in this recipe supposed to be non-alkalized?  Does such black cocoa powder exist? Does the ph of the 1/4 cup of cocoa powder matter in this recipe?",

      "description": "This dark chocolate cake relies on stout beer to add malted notes. Coffee helps enhance the chocolate flavor, and sour cream keeps the cake moist for days. A spiked coffee glaze studded with cacao nibs lends crunch and a nice bitter edge. This recipe calls for natural-process cocoa powder, which, along with other acidic ingredients like dark brown sugar, coffee, beer and sour cream, reacts with baking soda to make the cake rise. Dutch-process cocoa is chemically neutral and should not be substituted here, as it may cause your cake to rise unevenly and could produce an unpleasant flavor. Available from speciality baking supply stores and online, black cocoa powder is also used in this recipe to enhance the dark cocoa color and flavor, but feel free to substitute more natural cocoa powder.",
