      "description": "Richly flavored rundown, popular across the Caribbean, is the result of gently simmering seafood in coconut milk and tomatoes with aromatics such as scallions, onion and garlic until the flavors are concentrated and intense. Some say it gets its name from the way it lightly runs down and coats any starch or protein with which it comes into contact. At her restaurant, Bywater American Bistro, the chef Nina Compton tosses shrimp and house-made gnocchi with a rundown sauce made with the shrimp shells and scented with ginger and lemongrass. Here it’s served with cavatelli or shell pasta and is every bit as delicious. Lime zest plus a garnish of mixed soft herbs such as basil, chives and dill brighten the dish and add a hint of freshness.",

When a recipe has three things going on- thickening the sauce, finishing the cooking of the al dente pasta and cooking the shrimp, all in the same pot, the chance of this occurring in the same amount of time is slim.  The big loser, of course would be the shrimp.  To avoid this, I will saute the shrimp until just done and reserve.  When the pasta and sauce are done, I will add the shrimp to rewarm.",

Adding the pasta a couple minutes before it’s fully al dente and the shrimp at the same time and finishing it in the sauce with a ladleful of added pasta water (which will be absorbed with the sauce into the pasta) and butter/oil, depending, typically yields the best results. The shrimp needs about 3-5 minutes, which is exactly what the pasta needs in that situation as well.",

      "description": "Richly flavored rundown, popular across the Caribbean, is the result of gently simmering seafood in coconut milk and tomatoes with aromatics such as scallions, onion and garlic until the flavors are concentrated and intense. Some say it gets its name from the way it lightly runs down and coats any starch or protein with which it comes into contact. At her restaurant, Bywater American Bistro, the chef Nina Compton tosses shrimp and house-made gnocchi with a rundown sauce made with the shrimp shells and scented with ginger and lemongrass. Here it’s served with cavatelli or shell pasta and is every bit as delicious. Lime zest plus a garnish of mixed soft herbs such as basil, chives and dill brighten the dish and add a hint of freshness.",
