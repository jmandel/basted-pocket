      "description": "Among ash, a beloved category of thick soups in Iranian cuisine, ash reshteh is the most famous. Packed with legumes, a mountain of greens and reshteh, thin, flat noodles similar to linguine, it’s a hearty dish traditionally eaten on Chaharshanbe Suri, the Festival of Fire that falls on the Wednesday before Nowruz, the Persian New Year. The soup is finished with sizzled mint, crispy onions and kashk, an Iranian dairy product akin to a funkier sour cream. Kashk has a bold, umami-rich salty-sour flavor that’s unlike anything else. It’s worth trying to buy at a Middle Eastern market, but since it can be hard to find, a mix of lemon juice and sour cream or Greek yogurt makes a great substitute.",

I am sure you can make something perfectly good, but unless you can’t get an item like reshteh noodles or kashk (which have reasonable replacements), the specific elements are what make it so good.

To frizzle the 2 onions to top it, might take the full amount. A cup of oil seems like a lot, but if you are serving it to 6 people, especially if you aren't having meat, it adds to the nutrition, flavor and feel of the soup.",

After I added the beans to the sautéed onion and garlic, I added only 6 c of water and then pressure cooked for 11 minutes, then let it naturally release for 10 min. Beans and lentils were perfectly tender but still intact and not disintegrated",

You can use a combo of pre-soaked and canned beans if you want and substitute beans as you wish to cut down on time in the kitchen. Definitely don't skimp on the herbs or properlyetting the onions caramelize, they make this dish shine. I did add cumin based on other reviews and think that rounded it out nicely.",

The recipe was identical, so I am assuming this is pretty much a traditional preparation since my instructor was born in Iran. While I don’t mind improvisation, I personally wouldn’t on this one. I am sure you can make something perfectly good, but unless you can’t get an item like reshteh noodles or kashk (which have reasonable replacements), the specific elements are what make it so good. Consider trying it at least once as written!",

      "description": "Among ash, a beloved category of thick soups in Iranian cuisine, ash reshteh is the most famous. Packed with legumes, a mountain of greens and reshteh, thin, flat noodles similar to linguine, it’s a hearty dish traditionally eaten on Chaharshanbe Suri, the Festival of Fire that falls on the Wednesday before Nowruz, the Persian New Year. The soup is finished with sizzled mint, crispy onions and kashk, an Iranian dairy product akin to a funkier sour cream. Kashk has a bold, umami-rich salty-sour flavor that’s unlike anything else. It’s worth trying to buy at a Middle Eastern market, but since it can be hard to find, a mix of lemon juice and sour cream or Greek yogurt makes a great substitute.",
