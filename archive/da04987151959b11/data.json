        "transcript": "“Yeah. And then we just like sprinkle on top, because it could be optional. It’s not really optional. Everyone should do it, actually. Nothing is optional.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “Hi, I’m Sue Li. I am a food stylist, as well as a ‘New York Times’ contributor. And today we are going to make wontons for Dumpling Week. I love this version of a chili oil wonton. It’s a flavor that I tasted when I was a line cook in New York City. We would have late night takeout meals sometimes, and it was just a very familiar flavor. It was a pork and shrimp wonton with a chili oil sauce. It was like slightly sweet, and salty, and had peanuts on it. Here, I’ve tried to recreate it for you. So this wonton is actually a very classic wonton recipe. Let’s make the filling. I’m going to chop some shrimp. You don’t need to chop it super finely. I’m going to combine ground pork, chopped up shrimp, white pepper, salt, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, and soy sauce. You don’t really have to be afraid of overmixing. I’m going to combine all of these ingredients together until the flavors are evenly distributed.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “Now let’s head into wrapping our wontons. Set yourself up with a sheet tray, or any tray. Get a small bowl of water so that you can seal them properly. Dust it thoroughly with cornstarch. This is a wonton wrapper that you can pretty much buy in any grocery store. I hold it up in my hand like this, so that the two points are here and here. Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center. Dab my finger in a little bit of water. Wet the top edges of the wrapper, then seal it in half into a triangle. Make a divot in the center where the filling is. Shape it so that it looks like a fortune cookie, and then join showing the two edges together, like so. Now this is a shape that resembles a gold ingot. It’s a very lucky symbol that resembles wealth and fortune, and just good vibes to come.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “I think making dumplings is very meditative. I do go into a trance when I make it. I listen to a podcast or I work in silence.” Solo? “Solo. I don’t -- I don’t really like it when you come into the kitchen when I’m cooking, because people are messy, and I’m very controlling. This is my personality. And you can come and eat, and also do not help clean up.” “I’m blushing because I’m embarrassed. It’s true, though.” “You want to make some with me? Remember how I was like, ‘don’t come in my kitchen?’ That’s O.K. I’m just joking. I want you to stand right here. I’m going to tell you exactly what to do. We’ll do it together one time, and then there’s a test. Wrapper, just put the whole spoon in your wrapper. Water. And dab in the other.” “One strip, one strip that way.” “Pick the side up. Fold it in half into a triangle. Pinch, pinch, pinch to make a tight seal. Divot with your finger. And then what I would like you to do, you see this.” “Oh, it’s a very demure lady.” “It is a very -- I do think these are very demure.” “Oh, I did it.” “Yeah. Oh my God, it’s beautiful. Do this. Look at this perfect thing you made.” - [LAUGHS]: “Who’s holding it?” “Do it again. So here we have a tray of the wontons already assembled, cover it with plastic wrap, and set it in the refrigerator while we prepare the chili oil sauce. The sauce is so delicious. I made a recipe where you have to make a little extra. And that’s because you can add as much of the sauce as you want onto your wontons, or you can save it for another meal. I would like you to put in a heatproof bowl, preferably stainless, your scallions, garlic, pepper flakes, sesame seeds, Bay leaf, star anise. And then we’re going to heat up some vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it’s almost at a smoking point. The surface of the oil will first start to look like it’s shimmering, and it’s a little wavy, but all of a sudden, it’ll stop doing the shimmer. And that is about when you want to take it off and pour it over your seasoning.” [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHS] “So the dark soy sauce and the sweet soy sauce are essential. I almost want to say that they’re my cheats. You kind of can’t substitute that with sugar and soy sauce. You need to have these two ingredients to really add to the deep savoriness of this recipe. Let’s make some wontons. Let’s bring a pot of water to a boil. I’m going to do it in two batches. What I normally would like to do is swirl the water before I add the wontons. Think of it as your poultry and egg. You want to swirl your water so it doesn’t stick to the bottom. In about five to seven minutes, depending on how fast your pot comes back up to a boil, the wontons are now ready.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “And then you just do a nice drizzle. When I say a drizzle, I mean, flood it with a lot of sauce. And it can be finished here. You can serve it right away, but it’s also a very traditional thing to add the ground peanuts on top. And the extra bonus is the Sichuan peppercorns, which has that slight numbing flavor that people crave when they’re eating a dish like this. You want another bit of this bright, thinly sliced scallions on top. My mouth is watering. Let’s break for lunch.” [MUSIC PLAYING] “What I like to do is I like to toss them in the sauce a little while they’re in my bowl. They’re so good. I’m so proud of this recipe. You can taste the shrimp and the pork, and then the sauce on top. There’s a bit of a sweetness and the tanginess. Some crunch from the peanuts and the garlic that was in the sauce that has now crisped up. So these are the chili oil wontons. They’re so beautiful, actually. Look at that. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Very good fortune to you. Very good fortune to you. And if you want to find this recipe and the other dumpling recipes, please go to New York Times’ Cooking. I did it. Let’s eat. Are we done? O.K., great. Milton, I’m sorry you had to hear me chew.”",
