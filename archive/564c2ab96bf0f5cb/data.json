The tea pairs surprisingly well with the spice, as each accentuates the other's citrusy brightness and delicate floral notes. Cardamom’s sweet, peppery flavor lends extra warmth to every bite. Adding sour cream or yogurt to the batter plus opting for olive oil rather than butter not only ensures that the cake is ultratender, but allows it to stay that way for days so that it can be baked ahead of time without compromise.",

Also, for what it's worth, Fortnum & Mason has an Earl Grey variant called Victoria Grey.  It includes lavender and it is very floral and potent.  Maybe this tea will help stand up to the green cardamom? Or maybe it's too powerful of a one-two punch and will knock everyone out?! Anyway, I am looking forward to baking this cake this week."

      "description": "Clusters of cardamom-spiced brown sugar streusel crown this moist and fragrant Earl Grey cake that’s just sweet enough for breakfast, brunch or a mid-afternoon treat. The tea pairs surprisingly well with the spice, as each accentuates the other's citrusy brightness and delicate floral notes. Cardamom’s sweet, peppery flavor lends extra warmth to every bite. Adding sour cream or yogurt to the batter plus opting for olive oil rather than butter not only ensures that the cake is ultratender, but allows it to stay that way for days so that it can be baked ahead of time without compromise.",
