      "description": "This recipe is inspired by springtime and Bolognese bianco, or white Bolognese, a hearty Italian meat sauce made without tomato. It calls for ground lamb, but you can also use beef, pork or veal. The addition of cream to the simmering broth helps tenderize the lamb, and gives the sauce body. Incorporating starchy pasta water, then stirring it vigorously, creates a glossy, thick coating. Spinach, peas and lemon provide fresh, bright notes that balance the rich Bolognese. If fresh peas are available, cook them in the sauce for a few minutes before stirring in the spinach.",

I didnt have a problem w it not cooking down, but i probably had more than a cup of onions and equal amounts of carrot, so maybe that helped. Great spring dish!\nDefinitely could add some white wine, or mushrooms. I liked the simplicity of it and didnt think it needed a kick of crushed red pepper, but i also use a lot",

Drain the fat off the meat or skip the olive oil and cook the veggies in the fat from the lamb. Add 1/2 cup wine. Reduce the broth by 1/2. Reduce the cream by 1/2. Skip the butter. As written it is soupy, fatty. Unless your meat is super lean, the extra oil and butter are totally unnecessary.",

The pasta water is a great emulsifier.  Add judiciously.  As noted by the Roman chef in the comments, you don't need that much garlic.  Cook a couple whole cloves of garlic in the oil with the vegetables. Keep them in as you make the sauce, remove them later.  White wine adds complexity.  Overall a big hit in our household.

The sauce will be very thick, indeed the dissolved slow-cooked meat is the actual sauce. Pasta water at the end is sufficient to help it coat the pasta--usually fresh egg pasta like tagliatele; spaghetti does not pair well with densely textured meat sauces. We might brown one whole clove of garlic in the sauce and then remove it, but Italians fear garlic and would never add 6 chopped cloves.",

      "description": "This recipe is inspired by springtime and Bolognese bianco, or white Bolognese, a hearty Italian meat sauce made without tomato. It calls for ground lamb, but you can also use beef, pork or veal. The addition of cream to the simmering broth helps tenderize the lamb, and gives the sauce body. Incorporating starchy pasta water, then stirring it vigorously, creates a glossy, thick coating. Spinach, peas and lemon provide fresh, bright notes that balance the rich Bolognese. If fresh peas are available, cook them in the sauce for a few minutes before stirring in the spinach.",
