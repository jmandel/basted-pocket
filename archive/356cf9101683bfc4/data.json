      "description": "This soup offers the same sweet, tangy and savory flavor profile of the beloved Chinese dish stir-fried tomato and egg. Like the stir-fry, this tomato soup is on the sweet side, with sharpness from the untraditional addition of ketchup. There are several ways to drop an egg: Beating the eggs lightly will result in both white and yellow swirls, while running a chopstick or wooden spoon through the egg as it cooks will produce long, willowy strands. This recipe calls for dropping the egg into the hot soup and leaving it, which will give you chunks. A tip: If you have a liquid measuring cup with a spout, beat the egg in that, as it will give you more control when pouring the egg into the hot liquid. If you want the soup spicy, top with chile oil or chile crisp.",

It doesn’t have the eggs or tofu, but otherwise tastes exactly like this. It’s my favorite thing in the menu. \n\nI used a shallot in place of the scallion, because that’s what I had, and the vegetable Better Than Bouillon diluted to my taste. It looked thin in the pot, but it was actually perfect!",

I used 2 Tablespoon of gochujang sauce (no ketchup),  and only 1 Tablespoon of Brown Sugar instead of 2.  The soup was not too thin, and as soon as I added the eggs, it was perfect consistency.   I did grate some black pepper on top just before serving too.  YUM!",

Next time, I'll try it with mushrooms sautéd in butter and sherry. Note 2: I love the ginger in this recipe, though I'm not sure about the mouth feel.  Next time, I'll try using the pureed ginger (you buy it in a tube) to give it the same ginger flavor, minus the ginger crunch.",

      "description": "This soup offers the same sweet, tangy and savory flavor profile of the beloved Chinese dish stir-fried tomato and egg. Like the stir-fry, this tomato soup is on the sweet side, with sharpness from the untraditional addition of ketchup. There are several ways to drop an egg: Beating the eggs lightly will result in both white and yellow swirls, while running a chopstick or wooden spoon through the egg as it cooks will produce long, willowy strands. This recipe calls for dropping the egg into the hot soup and leaving it, which will give you chunks. A tip: If you have a liquid measuring cup with a spout, beat the egg in that, as it will give you more control when pouring the egg into the hot liquid. If you want the soup spicy, top with chile oil or chile crisp.",
