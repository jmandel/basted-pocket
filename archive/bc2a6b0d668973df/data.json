          "text": "Warning! If you are using DRY noodles, use less noodles! Try 2/3 of the amount of noodles if you are using dry noodles, so 10.7 oz if you are making a two-person batch with dry noodles. The noodles Maangchi has in the recipe need to be defrosted, so they are a type of fresh noodle. We did not think about this. We used angel hair pasta to make 1/2 batch to try it out because we had all the ingredients except the jjolmyeon noodles. It was so very tasty, but we had way too much noodles for the sauce and vegetables. We have an electric stove with coil burners. We toasted the gim by waving it an inch above the hot burner, not touching. Maangchi, thank you for another delicious recipe! Maybe make a note about using less dry noodles if someone can&#039;t get jjolmyeon? Also, you switch between &quot;jjolmyeon&quot; and &ldquo;jjolymyeon.&rdquo; Is there a difference?",

I found a recipe for &quot;instant&quot; gochujang made with fermented soybean paste and sugar instead of malt. Although I have no way of telling how close it is to the real thing, the final result with this recipe was extremely good so very I&#039;m glad! My red pepper flakes were of the spicier kind, though, so we were really getting our asses kicked XD (which we enjoy) I&#039;ll definitely make it again.",

          "text": "I made a really large 24 oz jar of the sauce in June, and keep it in the refrigerator. It won&#039;t go bad, since the gochujang and soy sauce both contain large amounts of salt. I&#039;d suggest making the sauce ahead of time, and cooking/rinsing the noodles just before serving. The noodles will get too soggy if you cook them and/or mix in the sauce that far in advance! Also, if you have access to perilla leaves (ggaennip), chiffonade some and try adding that. You can use naengmyeon noodles with this sauce as well. If using naengmyeon noodles, cubed watermelon (along with the mix-ins already suggested by Maangvhi) is a surprising tasty and popular combination in Korea. Hope that helped. :)",
