I disagree with reviewers who find it too sweet, I would say it's not very sweet at all, perfect for breakfast or tea. Fine-ground cornmeal works best; stone-ground will leave a few crunchy bits. I've used several different kinds of oil, I honestly don't think it matters much. Finally, this cake is best the next day.",

I had the leftovers for breakfast the next day with plain Greek yogurt to cut the sweetness. Will make again.",
