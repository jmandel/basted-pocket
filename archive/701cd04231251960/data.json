Was surprised to see that the one baked in cast iron baked up much quicker, puffier and browner than the one done in stainless.  Well - now I know!  Going to try a variation using very sharp cheddar and roasted green chiles instead of the gruyere.  Quick, easy and tasty dish....definitely a keeper.",
