          "text": "Maangchi noona!! Annyeonghaseyo?? I love to read your blog for the techniques. I live in Brazil and a lot of the ingredients are unavailable, but your techniques are so solid! I made these dumplings and I have some tips for your readers: 1. Don&#039;t try to roll the dough too thin. When the dumplings rise for the last time, the yeast bubbles will compromise the dough and they become like wet paper bags. If you can, keep the dough in the center of the circle (the bottom) thick, and the edges (the top) thin. Then you will have nice, even buns. 2. Get as much water out of the filling as you can. Either cook it out, or if you have a vegetarian filling (in my case), *wait*. If you don&#039;t, and you have a small steamer and you have to steam in batches (in my case), the water will inundate the bottom of the bun, and again, wet paper bag. Yeast is a living thing and if you don&#039;t respect it, you get soggy buns. :) 3. Don&#039;t be lazy making the sauce. These have a high bread-tp-filling ratio and they need to be seasoned after they&#039;re cooked. That&#039;s what the sauce is for. My wife loves you, maangchi!! Fighting!",

I added a tablespoon of Worchestershire Sauce along with the soy sauce and whatever to season it just because I could &lt;3 The only other ingredient alternations I made was using bamboo salt instead of normal salt and I used less because my father has high blood pressure, so there were no juices to drain out. I would like to say that having an electronic steamer (that my mom bought on a whim) made it a lot easier. The only problem was that it was not round but a bit flatish... but that may be because I tried to steam too much of it at once. The little girl I tutor loved it. She ate nine in one sitting and wouldn&#039;t share with her brothers and father. I&#039;ve gotten multiple comments that it was very clean and healthy tasting unlike store brands. This is the first recipe that I&#039;ve tried from your website and will be trying more (since I&#039;m trying to cook more Korean foods)",

          "text": "Hi Maangchi! I made these twice and both times my buns grew cute and big in the steamer and then after I opened the lid, rough hard yellowish spots appear on the surface of the buns. Looked like my buns had yellow rashes. I have the same steamer as yours except my lid is glass so I can see what&#039;s in there. I followed your directions to leave one inch gap between each bun and away from e sides of the steamer. :( I tried googling what&#039;s wrong and I came across people saying to prevent blemishes, open the lid quickly to prevent water droplets from dripping onto the buns. I did that, had blemishes. and I even cover the lid with a cloth to collect all the water droplets for one batch, didn&#039;t work. I placed dry cloth on the buns another batch and they still have blemishes. So I tried placing a parchment paper on top of the buns and also wrap a cloth around the lid. Still the same. Any idea what&#039;s wrong? :( I really want to make the good looking buns on top of them tasting great. If not I will be the only one eating these delicious babies :(",

I used chicken, ginger, chinese cabbage, mushrooms, a little onion and sweet spring cabbage. Maybe not very authentic but tasted great~~ I didn&#039;t have a big steamer so I could only do 4 buns at a time. I kept the rest in the fridge (I had 4 steaming racks) and took them out in time so that they rose while the previous batch was cooking. My buns turned out fluffy and delicious. :) Thank you for the recipe! I want to make these again soon.",

          "text": "Hey, Maangchi! It&#039;s interestsarefree from Flickr. I&#039;m not on there anymore. I decided to be here exclusively. I made hobakjuk for last year&#039;s Thanksgiving. This year, I made these! I got thirteen of them out of this recipe. I&#039;ll upload a picture soon. My family loved them, especially my mom. We both love steamed buns, but she prefers chapssalddeok as she loves sweet bean paste, known in Peru as frijol colado, except cloves and evaporated milk are added to it. I would apply for a visit to Peru for Gapshida!, but I live in New York. Love your recipes anyway! Go Maangchi!",
