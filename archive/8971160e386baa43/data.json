      "description": "This verdant soup has nuance: Celery, leeks and vermouth provide grassy notes, just subtle enough so as not to obscure the delicate flavor of the peas. Bright and sunny — and hearty and comforting with the optional addition of pasta — it tastes like spring, but can be prepared perennially. Unlike many one-note blended pea soups, this one celebrates textures and flavors: Divide your soup across several bowls, then add a spoonful of pasta and a dollop of crème fraîche for bright tanginess. Because this light soup is vegetable-based, drizzle it with plenty of olive oil, for richness, and pile on as many fresh herbs as you can. Lemon zest is a garnish, but nonnegotiable for this dish to sparkle.",

The next day it was still fresh as can be. I fried up pumpkin seeds, coriander, red pepper flakes and almond slivers. All in a bit of canola oil, mixed Garam massala and some sugar and salt.  \nSo the soup was decorated with parsley, lemon zest, spring onion,seed mix and crème fraîche. It needed contrasting flavors. It worked out beautifully.",

Great the way it is written but I found a couple of additions that were a slight improvement IMHO. I added a half avocado chopped up and 1/4c fresh mint.  I think the avocado gives the soup a great mouthfeel when blended with the other ingredients.  Enjoy!",

      "description": "This verdant soup has nuance: Celery, leeks and vermouth provide grassy notes, just subtle enough so as not to obscure the delicate flavor of the peas. Bright and sunny — and hearty and comforting with the optional addition of pasta — it tastes like spring, but can be prepared perennially. Unlike many one-note blended pea soups, this one celebrates textures and flavors: Divide your soup across several bowls, then add a spoonful of pasta and a dollop of crème fraîche for bright tanginess. Because this light soup is vegetable-based, drizzle it with plenty of olive oil, for richness, and pile on as many fresh herbs as you can. Lemon zest is a garnish, but nonnegotiable for this dish to sparkle.",
