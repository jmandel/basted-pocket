A couple notes: whenever I’ve cooked pearled couscous (sometimes called Israeli couscous), the directions have called for sautéing it first and then adding liquid, only enough liquid to be absorbed fully by the time the couscous is cooked—no draining required. I also eliminated one pan by cooking the couscous in the same pan as the shrimp. Will be happily making this again during the summer.",
