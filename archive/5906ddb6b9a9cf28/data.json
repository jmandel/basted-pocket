In turn, the oil will be tinted green and perfumed with an umami-saturated scallion aroma like nothing else. Be sure to dip crusty bread into that glorious scallion oil to enjoy with the tender fish.

If they're thin fillets, they'll cook in 2 or so minutes; the thicker ones need a little longer. Check the insides before eating and see that they're opaque.\nWorst case scenario, just heat the fish to temp over low. The key to this recipe is slow, gentle heat, more confit than fry.\nEric",

      "description": "For the most flavorful fish, gently poach the fillets in scallion oil, which is called pa gireum in Korean and is the star of this easy, foolproof preparation. Simmering scallions in olive oil over gentle heat removes moisture from the alliums, crisping them and concentrating their savoriness. In turn, the oil will be tinted green and perfumed with an umami-saturated scallion aroma like nothing else. Be sure to dip crusty bread into that glorious scallion oil to enjoy with the tender fish. This dish is great with rice, too.",
