I did use the lemon zest as well as the lemon juice which I highly recommend. Can't wait to make this again.",

In fact, start early and cook those cobs a little longer to get more flavor in the broth. I only used 1 tsp of turmeric and you may want to be cautious with it if you aren’t use to the flavor. Also, before serving I highly recommend you squeeze in the lemon juice, add the lemon zest, and toss in the ricotta—those components need to come together before serving.",

The only detail that benefits from fresh, is lightly flavouring the pasta water with the husks - but there’s so much flavour coming from caramelised corn, butter, the lemon, that the subtle sweetness imparted is not likely missed.\nIf I had a change? I think there’s a pinch too much tumeric, and I’d advise restraint. Go too heavy and it becomes almost curried and loses some of the summer farmers market lightness of touch implied in this excellent recipe.",

It’s not easy to cook corn to the point of browning without losing all its moisture, but a pinch of sugar helps speed up the caramelization process. Vermouth lends acidity to the light, glossy garlicky sauce, but you could use wine, or even a tablespoon of lemon juice or champagne vinegar for lift. Fresh ricotta provides richness.",
