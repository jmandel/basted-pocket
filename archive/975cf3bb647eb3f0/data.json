      "description": "The French long ago mastered eggs en cocotte —slightly coddled eggs baked at high heat with butter and cream, which thicken to a gravy as it cooks. There’s no finer way to enjoy an egg. To pull this off for a crowd, a large casserole dish coated with butter and partly filled with heavy cream acts as a bath in which to gently cook the eggs. To dress them up, add smoked salmon, a handful of kale or spinach leaves, thinly sliced ham, halved cherry tomatoes or sliced, cooked mushrooms to the mix before you crack in the eggs. Really anything goes here, but keep the accoutrements light and let the eggs take center stage. Finish with flaky sea salt (those large crystals melt on your tongue in just the right way) and any fresh herb you love.",

I added minced garlic and diced mushrooms to the sauté, then half pound of diced boars head ham before adding the cream along with minced chives. Once the cream began to warm, I added the eggs, other ingredients, and followed the recipe provided, and added fresh grated Parm.",

Don’t skimp on the heavy cream and butter. Will you die sooner? Maybe. Will you regret it? Definitely not. Highly recommend sautéing some thinly cut hearty greens like collards in an oven-proof pan, then add the cream and let it get warm, then add some fresh herbs and the eggs and butter on top. Don’t leave out the nutmeg. Then stick the pan in the oven.",

I only cooked 3 eggs so I just baked this for about 8 minutes on 400 degree heat (when I tried 500 it burned the cream around the edges of the small skillet). The second time I tried this, I seared some pancetta, cherry tomatoes, garlic and onions in the skillet before adding cream. If you’re gonna pre-cook some things adjust the cooking time as cream boils very quickly.",

With modifications based on the other reviews, used an 8” round ceramic pie dish, less cream (eyeballed it) quite a bit of chopped up ham (figured it would make it all less loose and runny) spices I had on hand (visiting friends- used what they had) 6 eggs, baked for 12-13 minutes. Still a little loose, but crisped the top a bit- I liked it! Felt lovely and French. Light, too. Better then a boring bleh strata! Pretty presentation, too",

      "description": "The French long ago mastered eggs en cocotte —slightly coddled eggs baked at high heat with butter and cream, which thicken to a gravy as it cooks. There’s no finer way to enjoy an egg. To pull this off for a crowd, a large casserole dish coated with butter and partly filled with heavy cream acts as a bath in which to gently cook the eggs. To dress them up, add smoked salmon, a handful of kale or spinach leaves, thinly sliced ham, halved cherry tomatoes or sliced, cooked mushrooms to the mix before you crack in the eggs. Really anything goes here, but keep the accoutrements light and let the eggs take center stage. Finish with flaky sea salt (those large crystals melt on your tongue in just the right way) and any fresh herb you love.",
