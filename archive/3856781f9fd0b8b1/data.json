The rice starts cooking while easy-to-eat salmon pieces are coated with savory miso and colorful turmeric. A bit of lime balances the rich flavors. It’s a recipe to play with, depending on whim and what you’ve got on hand: Swap the spinach for chopped chard or kale; stir in preserved lemon for brightness or sliced ginger for a warming kick; or serve with fresh avocado or radish slices.",

The rice starts cooking while easy-to-eat salmon pieces are coated with savory miso and colorful turmeric. A bit of lime balances the rich flavors. It’s a recipe to play with, depending on whim and what you’ve got on hand: Swap the spinach for chopped chard or kale; stir in preserved lemon for brightness or sliced ginger for a warming kick; or serve with fresh avocado or radish slices.",
