I found that I needed to microwave the cake about 15 seconds longer and the sauce was an overwhelming amount for the cake — way too sweet. Second time, I made half of the topping. It was near perfect, I wanted the cake itself to be richer. Third time, I still made half the topping but increased the dates to 3, I also added 1/2 tablespoon more of heavy cream to the cake because adding that 1 extra date dried the batter out a bit. This was the winning combination! This is such a genius hack recipe and it is scrumptious (my spouse agrees too.)",

If your brown sugar is rock hard like mine was, stir it into the hot dates/cream/butter mixture before you add the flour and cinnamon and it will crumble and melt into the cup pretty well. \n\nThe caramel sauce was perfect — sweet and sticky — and it thickened up just right while I followed the rest of the recipe. \n\nI whipped up the rest of a small carton of heavy cream with a splash of vanilla and dolloped it on top.",

As with any baking recipe, wet/dry ratios almost never work out right converted to GF so just expect to splash another bit of cream in and maybe some more sugar.  It seems like the batter should be something you could pour slowly if you wanted to, like a traditional cake batter would do.  Sadly my dates are old and dry so the mashing didn’t do much to express them - thankfully I have a jar of date syrup that’s been waiting for a nod, so will likely try that next time to make sure the sweetness is there in the batter.  I used coconut sugar but no concerns there, syrup turned out just fine.  I love STP as a dessert, excited to keep playing with this recipe!",

This speedy take on sticky toffee pudding is made for one or two people and doesn’t require turning on the oven — just the microwave. Topping your warm cake with cold ice cream, whipped cream or sour cream is a welcome contrast and helps temper the sweetness. A few toasted pecans on top would add a nice crunch.",
