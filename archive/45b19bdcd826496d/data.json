      "description": "With a golden broth, creamy chickpeas and bouncy angel hair noodles, this quick vegan soup will remind you of chicken noodle soup. To create a savory broth, sizzle carrots, celery and onion with nutritional yeast, turmeric and herbs in oil. A generous amount of oil adds silkiness to the broth and helps carry the flavor of the aromatics, while nutritional yeast gives the broth the soul-satisfying properties of chicken bouillon. While you can use broken pieces of any long noodle, angel hair is especially wonderful; delicate, soft and highly slurpable, they mimic the fine egg noodles found in many delis’ chicken noodle soup.",

There was not one chickpea skin surfacing in the soup. This is why I use Eden. I grated vegan Violife Parmesan cheese on the soup after plating along with a sprinkle of more nutritional yeast, salt and pepper. Served with fresh-baked Wild Grain sesame bread slices. It was fabulous.  We couldn’t get enough!",

Used loads of dill because I love it. Wow. I’ve cooked plant based for almost 10 years now and am sad I didn’t know how to make soup this comforting sooner. Thank you!!

      "description": "With a golden broth, creamy chickpeas and bouncy angel hair noodles, this quick vegan soup will remind you of chicken noodle soup. To create a savory broth, sizzle carrots, celery and onion with nutritional yeast, turmeric and herbs in oil. A generous amount of oil adds silkiness to the broth and helps carry the flavor of the aromatics, while nutritional yeast gives the broth the soul-satisfying properties of chicken bouillon. While you can use broken pieces of any long noodle, angel hair is especially wonderful; delicate, soft and highly slurpable, they mimic the fine egg noodles found in many delis’ chicken noodle soup.",
