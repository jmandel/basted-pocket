But in this recipe the key flavours are the fresh greens and the jalapeño/lemon/garlic combo. It’s fresh, it’s bright, it’s delicate; the olive oil compliments all of that. Just because you use soy sauce and tofu doesn’t mean you have to use sesame oil. Trust the writer - the olive oil Works here.",

I had shitakes, snap peas, baby greens and used red miso and a little veggie bullion paste instead of soy. I also happened to have the Yuzu Kosho which was at my Trader Joes. It is delicious, especially loved the texture of the soft tofu. Glad I skipped the sesame which some suggested. The delicate citrus flavor would have been lost.",

Was lucky to have everything neeeded. Made exactly as described, with the exception of the lemon zest/garlic mixture. Had no jalapeños so subbed-in red szechuan peppercorns, smashed and tossed straight into the broth. Also had frozen wild-caught Maine shrimp (the tiny ones) in the freezer and threw a handful into the pot. Fantastic.",

      "description": "This versatile (coincidentally vegan) soup can be customized with most quick-cooking vegetables — thinly sliced asparagus could easily be thinly sliced turnips or radishes — and whatever tofu you have access to. If tofu isn’t your thing, this soup would also be a great place to add any leftover chicken to warm through or shrimp to cook in the broth. The lemon at the end will breathe a lot of much-needed life into this broth built mostly from pantry staples, but a splash of rice wine vinegar would also do the trick.",
