          "text": "Hi Maangchi! I&rsquo;m so glad I found this recipe. My husband loves kalguksu and he really enjoyed this when I made it! I wanted to ask for some advice about the noodles though. I used corn starch instead of potato starch, but otherwise followed the recipe. The dough wouldn&rsquo;t come together like yours did in the video, so I ended up adding probably 1/4 cup more water. The dough then came together and looked good, but then it became really hard to roll out. It kept shrinking back when I tried to roll it out. I couldn&rsquo;t get it to roll out flat enough like yours and then my noodles became very thick. I guess I put too much water? But then I&rsquo;m not sure why the dough wouldn&rsquo;t come together initially. Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you!",

          "text": "I made the spicy version today, but since I can&#039;t roll out a large amount of dough at once, I made noodles similar to sujebi using the mandu-pi method. I used cornstarch instead of potato starch and 2 Tbs more water, more onions and a piece of leek in the already rich broth I had and skipped the zucchini and the green onions. Chicken legs instead of breast. Wonderful! I use a Chinese method for cooking chicken: Bring water with onion or stock to a boil, add the chicken (or parts) which should be submerged, bring to a boil again, let it cook gently for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the chicken in the covered pot for 30 minutes more or longer. Take it out, let it cool, remove the bones.",

I had to hold it up to the air, so that it stretches itself out due to its weight. After that I could roll it out. Unfortunately by layering and cutting it the noodles just stick together T-T Did I use too much oil or water? Thank u in advance for answering!",

Personally I was getting stomachaches from stress, but the rest of the company enjoyed it a lot, and that&#039;s what matters ^^. I ended up adding gochujang, regular soy sauce (due to the lack of soup soy sauce), chili sauce and flakes.. Hence the dark colour (oops). And two chicken broth cubes. They really added a lot of flavor, next time I&#039;m making this dish I&#039;ll be adding those waaay earlier :).",

When she asks for chicken soup, you wouldn&#039;t be able to resist. &quot;She hasn&rsquo;t contracted a single cold from her kindergarten classmates yet,..&quot; It sounds like she has been nourished by good food, so she can fight back any small germs!

          "text": "Hi, fantastic recipe. I made one batch per instructions and it was delicious. The second batch I made I had a few extra other things on hand and decided to use them. I substituted the zucchini with broccoli/carrot/cabbage slaw (also stir fried briefly). I also added a few large pieces of thinly sliced ginger. When making the garlic paste I also added the ginger and a few pieces of onion (each also finely minced then also made into a paste). The last touch was to steep enoki mushrooms into the chicken broth for about 30 seconds. Finally, I plated the dish noodles &gt; broccoli slaw &gt; chicken mixture &gt; enoki mushrooms &gt; broth &gt; green onion &gt; sprinkle of black sesame seeds for fun texture and color. A fun improvisation and mighty tasty, too. Thanks again, I love your food.",
