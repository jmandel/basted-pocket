You simply melt butter with rosemary and black pepper, stir that into dry ingredients, and then press the dough into a pan. Salted nuts and more fresh rosemary go on top before the whole thing is baked and broken into ragged pieces. Persnickety cookie, this is not. Enjoy on a cheese board, with cocktails or after dinner with tea and dark chocolate. Or pack these in a cellophane bag and tie it with a bow to share as a gift. (The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.)",

For some reason my guests were not keen on it as an appetizer with wine and instead preferred it as a slightly sweet desert. I also made it gluten free with mostly Bob’s Red Mill GF flour and a quarter GF oat floor.  It was great.  Don’t forget to add Xanthum gum for binding to replace gluten.  Also, I did a slight grinding of the nuts in the mini prep and had little problem with nuts adhering to the shortbread.",

After reading other people’s comments, I decided to mix the nuts into the dough rather than pressing them into the top to help them stick, which helped a lot. I also baked them for an additional 10 minutes at 300 on a separate sheet pan after breaking them into individual pieces to make them extra crispy. Next time I might sprinkle a little flaky sea salt on top in addition to the sugar.",

I over-baked it 5-10 minutes until it started to brown a bit more than one would want with a classic shortbread. This gave a deliciously crispy texture. I also think it helped the pieces hold together better, though there was still an abundance of delicious crumbles.",

The nuts were well embedded into the dough, but only adhered moderately well.  May try an egg wash or other coating to help them stick better next time, but that may create other textural issues.  Would like to try to achieve a crisper texture, may try a second bake like biscotti for more crunch.  Will bake in a parchment paper sling next time for easier removal and less disintegration.",

      "description": "Inspired by the cocktail nuts served at Union Square Cafe in New York City — butter-rich, toasty warm and fragrant with rosemary and cayenne — this no-mixer press-in cookie is a joy to make. You simply melt butter with rosemary and black pepper, stir that into dry ingredients, and then press the dough into a pan. Salted nuts and more fresh rosemary go on top before the whole thing is baked and broken into ragged pieces. Persnickety cookie, this is not. Enjoy on a cheese board, with cocktails or after dinner with tea and dark chocolate. Or pack these in a cellophane bag and tie it with a bow to share as a gift. (The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.)",
