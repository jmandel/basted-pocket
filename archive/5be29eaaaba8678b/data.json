Mint, fish sauce, raw red onion, you get the idea. But it does blend well and the crispy rice was a nice treat. It was my first time trying that and I ended up with an enormous pancake of rice I couldn’t imagine flipping, and it all started to fall apart from there. So some rice got nicely browned on both sides, some was still whitish on one side. My rice spent two days in the fridge dutifully waiting, and was sticky af when it went in the pan. That helped a lot, as did cranking up the burner to full high rather than medium high.",

We added crisp-fried seasoned extra firm tofu…for protein.  Endorse the idea of serving individual components separately - that will keep the rice crispy and dressing can be to individual taste.

Also, personally, I'd never add sugar to a salad dressing.  Again, just from eyeballing this recipe I know that I would not want to add sugar. To each their own.",

It needed a some palm sugar or other sweetener to balance the high level of acid in the lime juice, and it ended up overdressed by the sheer amount of it.

Overall, good effort on flavor combination but needed to pare back the dressing to allow the flavor of the vegetables like the green beans and peppers to even be tasted.",

We added crisp-fried seasoned extra firm tofu…for protein.  Endorse the idea of serving individual components separately - that will keep the rice crispy and dressing can be to individual taste.
