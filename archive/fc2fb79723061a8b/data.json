I am happier than I&#039;ve been in weeks. I had really been missing an important dimension of my life. Thank you Maangchi for teaching me how to make kimchi sundubu-jiggae. Tomorrow--seafood!",

I did not know if you are supposed to put rice in it or add it on top of rice so I just went with the former. In order to make this I made a huge batch of anchovy stock so that I could use it for other dishes later on as well. I even re-used some of the stock ingredients following the recipes in Maangchi&rsquo;s second book. It all turned out super yummy and my family really enjoyed the meal. I also made a salad just because my family and I usually have some kind of salad with our meal and it worked surprisingly well even though the recipe was not Korean hahaha. I thought I would share some pictures (keep in mind I am by no means a chef! I just really love cooking in my free time ^-^) Thank you so much for your great recipes Maangchi! &lt;3",

I always use this to replace pork in any dish. I left out the egg also, and used Indian Black Salt. It smells a bit like sulphur and worked really well to replace the egg. I also used the vegetarian broth from here and added little chunks of Korean radish to replace the cube and chunk texture of the pork. Lastly, I threw some enoki mushrooms on top near the end.",

Seafood sundubu-jiggae has been my favorite, but this one is really magical too. I think these two dishes are the peak of Korean cuisine for me so far and I don&#039;t know which I like better..

I thought I should save the half of it for tomorrow, having a spoon of the soup, and I ended up to finish all of the big potful... I will definitely make soon dubu tomorrow, again.

          "text": "Maangchi - when I lived in South Korea my husband and I used to go to a restaurant in Jinju where our favourite meal was Soondubu-jjigae, but it was always served it as plain soft tofu soup and then brought out different accompaniments that we could add to our soup for flavour. However when I search the internet, all recipes for soondubu-jjigae are spicy! Is this how it is normally served in restaurants? Perhaps Jinju makes their soup differently!",
