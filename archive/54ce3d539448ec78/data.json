If you don’t like spicy food, use miso instead of the gochujang and don’t use Sichuan peppercorns, which add a numbing, tingly pop to the fire. (If you like really spicy food, add dried chiles or hot pepper flakes to the recipe at the point you add the gochujang.) And if you want to make it even more luxe than it is already, follow the lead of Chang’s crew and stir 6 ounces of silken tofu into the sauce at the end.",

I have always omitted the sugar and Szechuan peppercorns. Otherwise I make it exactly as written. From the first time I diced the onions instead of sliced and I’ve stuck with that. I have once added the silken tofu as Sam suggested in the sauce at the end, and to be honest I couldn’t detect it….neither taste wise or texture wise. I’ll probably keep adding it for its nutritional value and doesn’t really ramp up the calories. Win-Win. \nSometimes I have been known to splash a bit of toasted sesame oil AND broad bean paste with chili oil to the sauce. I feel it amps up the umami quite a bit, especially because I never use the peppercorns. \nAnyway…thanks Sam for one of the best recipes I’ve ever had!",

They have to cook for almost 30 minutes, and this leaves plenty of time to do the rest of your prep work / mise-en-place. Also, I put the lid on my large all-clad pan once I added the kale to help it soften.   I will make this dish again and again!",

Drain and gently stir in to mingle with your ragu for a couple minutes at the end. It’s a lush, tasty add-in that makes perfect sense if you’ve enjoyed Mapo Doufu.",

      "description": "This is my simple, everyday take on a dish developed at Momofuku Ssam Bar in Manhattan many years ago by the chefs David Chang and Tien Ho and their band of collaborators. It is almost literally a mashup: a meal that is kind of Korean, kind of Chinese, kind of Italian. If you don’t like spicy food, use miso instead of the gochujang and don’t use Sichuan peppercorns, which add a numbing, tingly pop to the fire. (If you like really spicy food, add dried chiles or hot pepper flakes to the recipe at the point you add the gochujang.) And if you want to make it even more luxe than it is already, follow the lead of Chang’s crew and stir 6 ounces of silken tofu into the sauce at the end.",
