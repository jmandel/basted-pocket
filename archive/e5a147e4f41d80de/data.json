          "text": "Hi Maangchi! I found your amazing website through Crying in H-Mart, and have really been enjoying cooking some of your recipes, including your custard bread. I publish a newsletter called Good Book/Good Bread, where I recommend a book and then cook a bread or pastry that fits with an aspect of the book. This week&#039;s book was Crying in H-Mart, and I baked these delicious Kkwabaegi. My rolling leaves a lot of room for improvement compared to your beautiful looking ones, but they were so delicious and a lot of fun to make. Thank you for sharing such fantastic recipes-I learned a lot making this and am looking forward to cooking more from your site. If you are interested, the full newsletter is here: https://goodbookgoodbread.substack.com/p/twisted-korean-doughnuts-crying-in?s=w",

It will definitely stick to your fingers, but if you keep working it and build up the gluten it should come to together. Usually after the first proof step it stops being overly sticky. If you stick your finger on it before the first proof it should stick and maybe some may stick to you, but after it should stick but let go of your finger. I hope this has been helpful!",

Thank you for sharing your recipes, your memories, and your wonderful smile with us no matter what. Each time I make this recipe I think of what it means to you, and how lucky we are for you to share it. This dish reminds me of my year in Korea and all the wonderful foods I got to try there. I&#039;ve already made it again, but as a savory curry bun, and I&#039;m starting to feel the joy of cooking once more. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.",

          "text": "I made these today and they were sooooo good!! I won&rsquo;t lie I skipped dinner and just ate these doughnuts!!!! I don&rsquo;t like really sweet stuff so this was perfect for me. I want to try powdered sugar instead of cinnamon or maybe a light drizzle of condensed milk! Everyone in my family loved these and the best part is it&rsquo;s sooo cheap and easy to make. I had everything at home just needed a $2 pack of yeast. Rolling them is a little tricky but that will come with practice and watching them expand in the hot oil was so satisfying!! Thank you for this tutorial peace and love!!! -Rita",
