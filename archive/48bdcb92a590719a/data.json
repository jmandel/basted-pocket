I really look forward to finding out if I love these as much as the ones I&#039;m used to ordering! If we like them I&#039;ve decided to try it on a few other bean species including soybeans based on your recommendation up above. Have you ever tried using any other beans than soy or mung?? Hoping to find some variety for my stir fries this winter!",

In order to alleviate my frustration I decided to grow my own. After purchasing Mung Bean seeds on Amazon while waiting for the seeds to arrive I searched for &quot;growing Mung Beans&quot; with Google. Lucky for me you are the first and only click I made with the search! :-) Thank you for the useful Expert advice. is way more than I can use so I modified, by reducing,your amount of seeds, size of the container, and color of the cloth. The color was simply because I did not have a black cloth handy and assumed the important part was to block light. Here is a photo of the end of day 4 Once again my thanks and appreciation. I live alone and the 5 pound batch .",

I only had a cup of mung beans in the cupboard but even then i had a great harvest. Thank you so much for sharing how to grow our own bean sprouts. I also love kungnamol but i still have to find soybeans here in Sicily. I miss all the food back in Korea but now with your videos I can make my own but not all since some ingredients are not available in our island. Kamsahamnida, Maangchi!",

My sprouts look okay except for a little purple due to light exposure (sunny window where I watered them&quot;. But I&#039;m afraid to use them because some of the mung beans have brown spots on them. I put a few at the top of the pile in the picture . It seem to occur most with those at the top of my planter bucket. So I discarded those. Do I need to the discard everything? Is it mold or rot? Do you know how I can avoid that in the future and get the lemony yellow colored sprouts like yours ? I did place the planter next to a heating floorboard. It wasn&#039;t hot by any means but it was the warmer area of the house . Dumont beans prefer to be cooler ... like near a window ( I live in Boston so right now the windows are cool ).",

I don&#039;t think it is the bean because they have good color, organic and were taken from a bulk bin where the beans are replenish frequently. Also, they looked creamy when they first started to sprout. I bet the warmth near the baseboard was too drying for them...especially overnight. I don&#039;t wake up during the night like your mother. So the longer overnight duration between watering and the warmth probably did it. I&#039;m hoping a cooler spot will better match to my watering abilities. :-) I hope this is helpful to anyone else considering a warmer place. Nothing definitive; consider it a &#039;?&quot; at this point. I will report back after I try again.",
