          "reviewBody": "I haven’t tried this recipe yet, but a tip for producing that crisp crust on salmon:  Place your cast iron skillet over high heat on an outdoor grill and allow it to get very hot.  Add your well oiled fish, and let all the sizzle, spatter, and smell remain outdoors.  Reduce heat or move your pan to a cooler part of the grill.  Let the crust form and then flip your fish and allow it to finish at lower temp.  I never cook fish indoors anymore.",

Plus less spatter. I used cilantro, sesame seeds, and a combo of fennel and cumin.\n\nThe only thing is that you have to decide which side you want to remain crisp, as the one you put on the plate will go a little soggy.",

It was hard to gauge how much salt to use and there was far more yogurt\\herb mix than I needed for cooking and the sauce. And it smoked up the kitchen substantially. Also, I disturbed the seed crust when flipping the fish. I wonder if there is a way to avoid that.\nThe positives outweighed the negatives by a substantial margin",

I used mint, basil, and parsley for herbs and a seed mix I generally keep on hand (flax, chia, sunflower, black sesame) along with fennel seeds. They are powerful flavors but salmon can stand up to something like that. I had it along with a basic cabbage slaw dressed with the leftover yoghurt and herbs.",

      "description": "This recipe produces not only silky salmon with a crunchy coating of fragrant seeds, but also a shatteringly crisp skin. That’s all thanks to yogurt, which secures the seeds to the salmon and caramelizes into a crust when cooked. Mix assertive and mild seeds for a balance of textures and flavors, or swap in a ready-made seed mix like everything bagel spice or dukkah. Eat the seared salmon with more yogurt, as well as a squeeze of citrus and tuft of herbs for freshness.",
