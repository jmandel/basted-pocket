Here the mixture is spread over chicken thighs, which are then roasted to golden perfection. But you could easily use it on salmon or flounder, on corn or potatoes. The recipe calls for white miso, which is more mild than the aged version known as red miso. But you could certainly use red for a more intense result.",

They were nicely caramelized and very tasty.  I served them on a bed of steamed Swiss chard which was a good vehicle for the sauce.  Paired it with Moroccan spiced spaghetti squash with chick peas and dates.  A fine supper!",

The suggestions of subbing in sesame oil or tahini are right on.  And adding zaatar and/or pimenton to the rub gives more depth of flavor.  As far as crisping the skin, I used a convection oven at 400, and it worked fine (actually it was delicious).  So I know it's possible.  You may have to experiment a bit with your own setup.",

      "description": "Making a compound of unsalted butter and the salty, fungal deliciousness of Japanese miso paste is a surefire way of adding immense flavor to a simple weeknight meal. Here the mixture is spread over chicken thighs, which are then roasted to golden perfection. But you could easily use it on salmon or flounder, on corn or potatoes. The recipe calls for white miso, which is more mild than the aged version known as red miso. But you could certainly use red for a more intense result.",
