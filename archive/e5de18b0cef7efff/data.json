Next time, I'll use about twice as much bok choy.  I weighed out the ingredients, so I know I used the right amount, it just wasn't enough for my tastes.",

The poaching liquid does double duty by gently cooking the fish and wilting the bok choy. If bok choy is unavailable, another sturdy green, like kale or Napa cabbage, can be substituted. Serve with steamed jasmine rice to soak up some of the fragrant coconut milk broth.",
